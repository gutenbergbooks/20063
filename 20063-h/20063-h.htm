Theodoric the Ostrogoth. The plan
of the series, for which this volume
has been prepared, does not admit of
minute discussion of the authorities on
which the history rests. In my case the
omission is of the less consequence, as I have treated
the subject more fully in my larger work, "Italy
and her Invaders", and as also the chief authorities
are fully enumerated in that book which is or ought
to be in the library of every educated Englishman
and American, Gibbon's "History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire".</p>

<p class="fixed">The fifth and sixth centuries do not supply us
with many materials for pictorial illustrations, and
I do not know where to look for authentic and contemporary
representations of the civil or military life
of Theodoric and his subjects. We have, however,
a large and interesting store of nearly contemporary
works of art at Ravenna, illustrating the ecclesiastical
<a name="pvi" id="pvi"></a><span class="pagenum">vi</span>
life of the period, and of these the engraver has
made considerable use. The statue of Theodoric at
Innsbruck, a representation of which is included with
the illustrations, possesses, of course, no historical
value, but is interesting as showing how deeply the
memory of Theodoric's great deeds had impressed
itself on the mind of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="fixed">And here I will venture on a word of personal
reminiscence. The figure of Theodoric the Ostrogoth
has been an interesting and attractive one to me
from the days of my boyhood. I well remember
walking with a friend on a little hill (then silent and
lonely, now covered with houses), looking down on
London, and discussing European politics with the
earnest interest which young debaters bring to such
a theme. The time was in those dark days which
followed the revolutions of 1848, when it seemed as
if the life of the European nations would be crushed
out under the heel of returned and triumphant despotism.
For Italy especially, after the defeat of
Novara, there seemed no hope. We talked of Mazzini,
Cavour, Garibaldi, and discussed the possibility--which
then seemed so infinitely remote--that there
might one day be a free and united Italy. We both
agreed that the vision was a beautiful one, but was
there any hope of it ever becoming a reality? My
friend thought there was not, and argued from the
fact of Italy's divided condition in the past, that
she must always be divided in the future. I, who
was on the side of hope, felt the weakness of my
position, and was driven backward through the centuries,
till at length I took refuge in the reign of
<a name="pviii" id="pviii"></a><span class="pagenum">viii</span>
Theodoric. Surely, under the Ostrogothic king,
Italy had been united, strong, and prosperous. My
precedent was a remote one, but it was admitted,
and it did a little help my cause.</p>

<p class="fixed">Since that conversation more than forty years
have passed. The beautiful land is now united, free,
and mighty; and a new generation has arisen, which,
though aware of the fact that she was not always
thus, has but a faint conception how much blood
and how many tears, what thousands of broken
hearts and broken lives went to the winning of
Italy's freedom. I, too, with fuller knowledge of her
early history, am bound to confess that her unity
even under Theodoric was not so complete as I
then imagined it. But still, as I have more than
once stated in the following pages, I look upon his
reign as a time full of seeds of promise for Italy and
the world, if only these seeds might have had time
to germinate and ripen into harvest. Closer study
has only confirmed me in the opinion that the
Ostrogothic kingdom was one of the great "Might-have-beens"
of History.</p>

<h1>THEODORIC THE GOTH.</h1>

<br><br>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

[Illustration]

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/007.png">heodoric the Ostrogoth is
one of those men who did great
deeds and filled a large space in
the eyes of their contemporaries,
but who, not through their own
fault, but from the fact that the
stage of the world was not yet
ready for their appearance, have
failed to occupy the very first rank
among the founders of empires and the moulders
of the fortunes of the human race.</p>

<p>He was born into the world at the time when the
Roman Empire in the West was staggering blindly
to ruin, under the crushing blows inflicted upon it
by two generations of barbarian conquerors. That
Empire had been for more than six centuries indisputably
<a name="p2" id="p2"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 2</span>
the strongest power in Europe, and had
gathered into its bosom all that was best in the
civilisation of the nations that were settled round
the Mediterranean Sea. Rome had given her laws
to all these peoples, had, at any rate in the West,
made their roads, fostered the growth of their cities,
taught them her language, administered justice, kept
back the barbarians of the frontier, and for great
spaces of time preserved "the Roman peace"
throughout their habitations. Doubtless there was
another side to this picture: heavy taxation, corrupt
judges, national aspirations repressed, free peasants
sinking down into hopeless bondage. Still it cannot
be denied that during a considerable part of its existence
the Roman Empire brought, at least to the
western half of Europe, material prosperity and
enjoyment of life which it had not known before,
and which it often looked back to with vain regrets
when the great Empire had fallen into ruins. But
now, in the middle of the fifth century, when
Theodoric was born amid the rude splendour of
an Ostrogothic palace, the unquestioned ascendancy
of Rome over the nations of Europe was a thing of
the past. There were still two men, one at the Old
Rome by the Tiber, and the other at the New Rome
by the Bosphorus, who called themselves August,
Pious, and Happy, who wore the diadem and the
purple shoes of Diocletian, and professed to be joint
lords of the universe. Before the Eastern Augustus
and his successors there did in truth lie a long future
of dominion, and once or twice they were to recover
no inconsiderable portion of the broad lands which
<a name="p3" id="p3"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 3</span>
had formerly been the heritage of the Roman people.
But the Roman Empire at Rome was stricken
with an incurable malady. The three sieges and the
final sack of Rome by Alaric (410) revealed to the
world that she was no longer "Roma Invicta", and
from that time forward every chief of Teutonic or
Sclavonic barbarians who wandered with his tribe
over the wasted plains between the Danube and the
Adriatic, might cherish the secret hope that he, too,
would one day be drawn in triumph up the Capitolian
Hill, through the cowed ranks of the slavish
citizens of Rome, and that he might be lodged on the
Palatine in one of the sumptuous palaces which had
been built long ago for "the lords of the world".</p>

<p>Thus there was everywhere unrest and, as it were,
a prolonged moral earthquake. The old order of
things was destroyed, and none could forecast the
shape of the new order of things that would succeed
to it. Something similar has been the state of
Europe ever since the great French Revolution;
only that her barbarians threaten her now from
within, not from without. The social state which
had been in existence for centuries, and which had
come to be accepted as if it were one of the great
ordinances of nature, is either menaced or is actually
broken up, and how the new democracy will rearrange
itself in the seats of the old civilisation the
wisest statesman cannot foretell.</p>

<p>But to any "shepherd of his people", barbarian or
Roman, who looked with foreseeing eye and understanding
heart over the Europe of the fifth century,
the duty of the hour was manifest. The great
<a name="p4" id="p4"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 4</span>
fabric of the Roman Empire must not be allowed
to go to pieces in hopeless ruin. If not under
Roman Augusti, under barbarian kings bearing one
title or another, the organisation of the Empire
must be preserved. The barbarians who had entered
it, often it must be confessed merely for
plunder, were remaining in it to rule, and they
could not rule by their own unguided instincts.
Their institutions, which had answered well enough
for a half-civilised people, leading their simple, primitive
life in the clearings of the forest of Germany,
were quite unfitted for the complicated relations of
the urban and social life of the Mediterranean lands.
There is one passage<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a>
<a href="#footnote4"><sup class="sml">4</sup></a> which has been quoted almost
to weariness, but which it seems necessary to quote
again, in order to show how an enlightened barbarian
chief looked upon the problem with which he found
himself confronted, as an invader of the Empire.
Ataulfus, brother-in-law and successor of Alaric, the
first capturer of Rome, "was intimate with a certain
citizen of Narbonne, a grave, wise, and religious person
who had served with distinction under Theodosius,
and often remarked to him that in the first
ardour of his youth he had longed to obliterate the
Roman name and turn all the Roman lands into an
Empire which should be, and should be called, the
Empire of the Goths, so that what used to be commonly
known as Romania should now be 'Gothia,'
and that he, Ataulfus, should be in the world what
Cæsar Augustus had been. But now that he had
proved by long experience that the Goths, on account
<a name="p5" id="p5"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 5</span>
of their unbridled barbarism, could not be induced
to obey the laws, and yet that, on the other hand,
there must be laws, since without them the Commonwealth
would cease to be a Commonwealth, he had
chosen, for his part at any rate, that he would seek
the glory of renewing and increasing the Roman
name by the arms of his Gothic followers, and
would be remembered by posterity as the restorer
of Rome, since he could not be its changer".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote4"
name="footnote4"></a><b>Footnote 4:</b><a href="#footnotetag4">
(return) </a>Footnote 4: Orosius Histor., vii., 43.</blockquote>

<p>This conversation will be found to express the
thoughts of Theodoric the Ostrogoth, as well as
those of Ataulfus the Visigoth, Theodoric also, in
his hot youth, was the enemy of the Roman name
and did his best to overturn the Roman State. But
he, too, saw that a nobler career was open to him
as the preserver of the priceless blessings of Roman
civilisation, and he spent his life in the endeavour to
induce the Goths to copy those laws, without which
a Commonwealth ceases to be a Commonwealth. In
this great and noble design he failed, as has been
already said, because the times were not ripe for it,
because a continuation of adverse events, which we
should call persistent ill-luck if we did not believe in
an overruling Providence, blighted and blasted his
infant state before it had time to root itself firmly in
the soil. None the less, however, does Theodoric
deserve credit for having seen what was the need of
Europe, and pre-eminently of Italy, and for having
done his best to supply that need. The great work
in which he failed was accomplished three centuries
later by Charles the Frank, who has won for himself
that place in the first rank of world-moulders which
<a name="p6" id="p6"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 6</span>
Theodoric has missed. But we may fairly say that
Theodoric's designs were as noble and as statesmanlike
as those of the great Emperor Charles, and that
if they had been crowned with the success which
they deserved, three centuries of needless barbarism
and misery would have been spared to Europe.</p>

Century--Hermanric the Ostrogoth--Inroad of the Huns--Defeat

<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/010.png">owards the end of the second
century of the Christian Era a
great confederacy of Teutonic nations
occupied those vast plains
in the south of Russia which are
now, and have been for more than
a thousand years, the homes of
Sclavonic peoples. These nations
were the Ostrogoths, the Visigoths,
and the Gepidæ. Approximately we may say
that the Ostrogoths (or East Goths) dwelt from the
Don to the Dnieper, the Visigoths (or West Goths)
from the Dnieper to the Pruth, and the Gepidæ to
the north of both, in the district which has since been
known as Little Russia. These three nations were,
as has been said, Teutons, and they belonged to that
division of the Teutonic race which is called Low-German,
<a name="p8" id="p8"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 8</span>
man; that is to say, that they were more nearly allied
to the Frisians, the Dutch, and to our own Saxon
forefathers than they were to the ancestors of the
modern Swabian, Bavarian, and Austrian. They worshipped
Odin and Thunnor; they wrote the scanty
records of their race in Runic characters; they were
probably chiefly a pastoral folk, but may have begun
to practise agriculture in the rich cornlands of
the Ukraine. They were essentially a monarchic
people, following their kings, whom they believed to
be sprung from the seed of gods, loyally to the
field, and shedding their blood with readiness at
their command; but their monarchy was of the early
Teutonic type, always more or less limited by the
deliberations of the great armed assembly of the nation,
which (in some tribes at least) was called the
Folc-mote or the Folc-thing; and there were no strict
rules of hereditary succession, the crown being elective
but limited in practice to the members of one
ruling and heaven-descended family.</p>

<p>This family, sprung from the seed of gods, but
ruling by the popular will over the Ostrogothic people,
was known as the family of the Amals. It is
true that the divine and exclusive prerogatives of the
family have been somewhat magnified by the minstrels
who sang in the courts of their descendants, for
there are manifest traces of kings ruling over the
Ostrogothic people, who are not included in the
Amal genealogy. Still, as far as we can peer through
the obscurity of the early history of the people, we
may safely say that there was no other family of
higher position than the Amals, and that gradually
all that consciousness of national life and determination
<a name="p9" id="p9"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 9</span>
to cherish national unity, which among the Germanic
peoples was inseparably connected with the
institution of royalty, centred round the race of the
divine Amala.</p>

<p>The following is the pedigree of this royal clan, as
given by the historian of the Goths,<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a>
<a href="#footnote5"><sup class="sml">5</sup></a> and with those
epithets which the secretary of Theodoric<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a>
<a href="#footnote6"><sup class="sml">6</sup></a> attached
to the names of some of the ancestors of his lord.
(The names of those who wore the crown are marked
in italics.)</p>

<a name="p10" id="p10"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 10</span>
<p>These fifteen generations, which should carry back
the Amal ancestry four hundred and fifty years, or
almost precisely to the Christian Era, seem to have
marked the utmost limit to which the memory of the
Gothic heralds, aided by the songs of the Gothic
minstrels, could reach. The forms of many of the
names, the initial "Wala" and "Theude", the terminal
"wulf", "mir", and "mund" will be at once
recognised as purely Teutonic, recalling many similar
names in the royal lines of the Franks, the
Visigoths and the Vandals, and the West Saxons.</p>

<p>In the great, loosely knit confederacy which has
been described as filling the regions of Southern
Russia in the third and fourth centuries of our Era,
the predominant power seems to have been held by
the Ostrogothic nation. In the third century, when
a succession of weak ephemeral emperors ruled and
all but ruined the Roman State, the Goths swarmed
forth in their myriads, both by sea and land, to
ravage the coast of the Euxine and the Ægean, to
cross the passes of the Balkans, to make their desolating
presence felt at Ephesus and at Athens. Two
great Emperors of Illyrian origin, Claudius and
Aurelian, succeeded, at a fearful cost of life, in repelling
the invasion and driving back the human
torrent. But it was impossible to recover from the
barbarians Trajan's province of Dacia, which they
had overrun, and the Emperors wisely compromised
the dispute by abandoning to the Goths and their
allies all the territory north of the Danube. This
abandoned province was chiefly occupied by the
Visigoths, the Western members of the confederacy,
<a name="p11" id="p11"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 11</span>
who for the century from 275 to 375 were the neighbours,
generally the allies, by fitful impulses the
enemies, of Rome. With Constantine the Great
especially the Visigoths came powerfully in contact,
first as invaders and then as allies (<i>fœderati</i>) bound
to furnish a certain number of auxiliaries to serve
under the eagles of the Empire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Ostrogoths, with their faces turned
for the time northward instead of southward, were
battling daily with the nations of Finnish or Sclavonic
stock that dwelt by the upper waters of the
Dnieper, the Don, and the Volga, and were extending
their dominion over the greater part of what we
now call Russia-in-Europe. The lord of this wide
but most loosely compacted kingdom, in the middle
of the fourth century, was a certain Hermanric,
whom his flatterers, with some slight knowledge of
the names held in highest repute among their
Southern neighbours, likened to Alexander the
Great for the magnitude of his conquests. However
shadowy some of these conquests may appear
in the light of modern criticism, there can be little
doubt that the Visigoths owned his over-lordship,
and that when Constantius and Julian were reigning
in Constantinople, the greatest name over a wide
extent of territory north of the Black Sea was that
of Hermanric the Ostrogoth.</p>

<p>When this warrior was in extreme old age, a terrible
disaster befell his nation and himself. It was
probably about the year 374 that a horde of Asiatic
savages made their appearance in the south-eastern
corner of his dominions, having, so it is said, crossed
<a name="p12" id="p12"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 12</span>
the Sea of Azof in its shallowest part by a ford.
These men rode upon little ponies of great speed
and endurance, each of which seemed to be incorporated
with its rider, so perfect was the understanding
between the horseman, who spent his days
and nights in the saddle, and the steed which he
bestrode. Little black restless eyes gleamed beneath
their low foreheads and matted hair; no beard or
whisker adorned their uncouth yellow faces; the
Turanian type in its ugliest form was displayed by
these Mongolian sons of the wilderness. They bore
a name destined to be of disastrous and yet also
indirectly of most beneficent import in the history
of the world; for these are the true shatterers of the
Roman Empire. They were the terrible Huns.</p>

<p>Before the impact of this new and strange enemy
the Empire of Hermanric--an Empire which rested
probably rather on the reputation of warlike prowess
than on any great inherent strength, military
or political--went down with a terrible crash. Dissimilar
as are the times and the circumstances, we
are reminded of the collapse of the military systems
of Austria and Prussia under the onset of the ragged
Jacobins of France, shivering and shoeless, but full of
demonic energy, when we read of the humiliating
discomfiture of this stately Ostrogothic monarchy--doubtless
possessing an ordered hierarchy of nobles,
free warriors, and slaves--by the squalid, hard-faring
and, so to say, democratic savages from Asia.</p>

<p>The death of Hermanric, which was evidently due
to the Hunnish victory, is assigned by the Gothic
historian to a cause less humiliating to the national
<a name="p13" id="p13"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 13</span>
vanity. The king of the Rosomones, "a perfidious
nation", had taken the opportunity of the appearance
of the savage invaders to renounce his
allegiance, perhaps to desert his master treacherously
on the field of battle. The enraged Hermanric,
unable to vent his fury on the king himself,
caused his wife, Swanhilda, to be torn asunder by
wild horses to whom she was tied by the hands and
feet. Her brothers, Sarus and Ammius, avenged
her cruel death by a spear-thrust, which wounded
the aged monarch, but did not kill him outright.
Then came the crisis of the invasion of the Huns
under their King Balamber. The Visigoths, who
had some cause of complaint against Hermanric,
left him to fight his battle without their aid; and
the old king, in sore pain with his wound and deeply
mortified by the incursion of the Huns, breathed
out his life in the one hundred and tenth year of his
age. All of which is probably a judicious veiling of
the fact,<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a>
<a href="#footnote7"><sup class="sml">7</sup></a> that the great Hermanric was defeated by
the Hunnish invaders, and in his despair laid violent
hands on himself.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote7"
name="footnote7"></a><b>Footnote 7:</b><a href="#footnotetag7">
(return) </a> Mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus.</blockquote>

<p>The huge and savage horde rolled on over the
wide plains of Russia. The Ostrogothic resistance
was at an end; and soon the invaders were on the
banks of the Dniester threatening the kindred nation
of the Visigoths. Athanaric, "Judge" (as he was
called) of the Visigoths, a brave, old soldier, but not
a very skilful general, was soon out-manœuvred by
these wild nomads from the desert, who crossed the
rivers by unexpected fords, and by rapid night-marches
<a name="p14" id="p14"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 14</span>
turned the flank of his most carefully
chosen positions. The line of the Dniester was
abandoned; the line of the Pruth was lost. It was
plain that the Visigoths, like their Eastern brethren,
if they remained in the land, must bow their heads
beneath the Hunnish yoke. To avoid so degrading
a necessity, and if they must lose their independence,
to lose it to the stately Emperors of Rome
rather than to the chief of a filthy Tartar horde, the
great majority of the Visigothic nation flocked
southward through the region which is now called
Wallachia, and, standing on the northern shore of
the Danube, prayed for admission within the province
of Mœsia and the Empire of Rome. In 376
an evil hour for himself Valens, the then
reigning Emperor of the East, granted this petition
and received into his dominions the Visigothic fugitives,
a great and warlike nation, without taking any
proper precautions, on the one hand, that they should
be disarmed, on the other, that they should be supplied
with food for their present necessities and enabled
for the future to become peaceful cultivators
of the soil. The inevitable result followed. Before
many months had elapsed the Visigoths were in
arms against the Empire, and under the leadership of
their hereditary chiefs were wandering up and down
through the provinces of Mœsia and Thrace, wresting
from the terror-stricken provincials not only the
food which the parsimony of Valens had failed to
supply them with, but the treasures which centuries of
peace had stored up in villa and unwalled town. In
378 they achieved a brilliant, and perhaps unexpected,
<a name="p15" id="p15"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 15</span>
triumph, defeating a large army commanded
by the Roman Emperor Valens in person, in a
pitched battle near Adrianople. Valens himself perished
on the field of battle, and his unburied corpse
disappeared among the embers of a Thracian hut
which had been set fire to by the barbarians. That
fatal day (August 9, 378) was admitted to be more
disastrous for Rome than any which had befallen
her since the terrible defeat of Cannæ, and from it
we may fitly date the beginning of that long process
of dissolution, lasting, in a certain sense, more than
a thousand years, which we call the Fall of the
Roman Empire.</p>

<p>In this long tragedy the part of chief actor fell,
during the first act, to the <i>Visigothic nation</i>. With
their doings we have here no special concern. It is
enough to say that for one generation they remained
in the lands south of the Danube, first warring
against Rome, then, by the wise policy of their
conqueror, Theodosius, incorporated in her armies
under the title of <i>fœderati</i> and serving her in the
main with zeal and fidelity. In 395<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a>
<a href="#footnote8"><sup class="sml">8</sup></a> a Visigothic
chief, Alaric by name, of the god-descended seed of
Balthæ, was raised upon the shield by the warriors
of his tribe and hailed as their king. His elevation
seems to have been understood as a defiance to the
Empire and a re-assertion of the old national freedom
which had prevailed on the other side of the Danube.
At any rate the rest of his life was spent either in
hostility to the Empire or in a pretence of friendship
almost more menacing than hostility. He began by
<a name="p16" id="p16"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 16</span>
invading Greece and penetrated far south into the
Peloponnesus. He then took up a position in the
province of Illyricum--probably in the countries
now known as Bosnia and Servia--from which he
could threaten the Eastern or Western Empire at
pleasure. Finally, with the beginning of the fifth
century after Christ, he descended into Italy, and
though at first successful only in ravage, in the
second invasion he penetrated to the very heart of
the Empire. His three sieges of Rome, ending in
the awful event of the capture and sack of the Eternal
City in 410, are events in the history of the world
with which every student is familiar. Only it may
be remarked that the word awful, which is here used
designedly, is not meant to imply that the loss of
life was unusually large or the cruelty of the captors
outrageous; in both respects Alaric and his Goths
would compare favourably with some generals and
some armies making much higher pretensions to
civilisation. Nor is it meant that the destruction of
the public buildings of the city was extensive. There
can be little doubt that Paris, on the day after the
suppression of the "Commune" in 1871, presented
a far greater appearance of desolation and ruin than
Rome in 410, when she lay trembling in the hand of
Alaric. But the bare fact that Rome herself, the
Roma Æterna, the Roma Invicta of a thousand
coins of a hundred Emperors,--Rome, whose name
for centuries on the shores of the Mediterranean had
been synonymous with worldwide dominion,--should
herself be taken, sacked, dishonoured by the presence
of a flaxen-haired barbarian conqueror from the
<a name="p17" id="p17"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 17</span>
North, was one of those events apparently so contrary
to the very course of Nature itself, that the
nations which heard the tidings, many of them old
and bitter enemies of Rome, now her subjects and
her friends, held their breath with awe at the terrible
recital.</p>

(return) </a> Probably. Some historians put the date in 382, others in 400.</blockquote>

<p>Alaric died shortly after his sack of Rome, and
after a few years of aimless fighting his nation
quitted Italy, disappearing over the north-western
Alpine boundary to win for themselves new settlements
by the banks of the Garonne and the Ebro.
Their leader was that Ataulfus whose truly statesmanlike
reflections on the unwisdom of destroying the
Roman Empire and the necessity of incorporating the
barbarians with its polity have been already quoted.
There, in the south-western corner of Gaul and the
northern regions of Spain, we must for the present
leave the Western branch of the great Gothic nationality,
while our narrative returns to its Eastern
representatives.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<h3>THE MIGHT OF ATTILA.</h3>

<p>The Ostrogoths under the Huns--The three royal brothers--Attila
king of the Huns--He menaces the Eastern Empire--He strikes
at Gaul--Battle of the Catalaunian plains--Invasion of
Italy--Destruction of Aquileia--Death of Attila and disruption of his
Empire--Settlement of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/015.png">or eighty years the power of the
Ostrogoths suffered eclipse under
the shadow of Hunnish barbarism.
As to this period we have
little historical information that is
of any value. We hear of resistance
to the Hunnish supremacy
vainly attempted and sullenly
abandoned. The son and the
grandson of Hermanric figure as the shadowy heroes
of this vain resistance. After the death of the latter
(King Thorismund) a strange story is told us of the
nation mourning his decease for forty years, during
all which time they refused to elect any other king

<a name="p19" id="p19"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 19</span>
to replace him whom they had lost. There can be
little doubt that this legend veils the prosaic fact
that the nation, depressed and dispirited under the
yoke of the conquering Huns, had not energy or
patriotism enough to choose a king; since almost
invariably among the Teutons of that age, kingship
and national unity flourished or faded together.</p>

<p>At length, towards the middle of the fifth century
after Christ, the darkness is partially dispelled, and
we find the Ostrogothic nation owning the sovereignty
of three brothers sprung from the Amal race,
but not direct descendants of Hermanric, whose
names are Walamir, Theudemir, and Widemir.
"Beautiful it was", says the Gothic historian, "to
behold the mutual affection of these three brothers,
when the admirable Theudemir served like a common
soldier under the orders of Walamir; when
Walamir adorned him with the crown at the same
time that he conveyed to him his orders; when
Widemir gladly rendered his services to both of his
brothers".<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a>
<a href="#footnote9"><sup class="sml">9</sup></a> Theudemir, the second in this royal
brotherhood, was the father of our hero, Theodoric.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote9"
name="footnote9"></a><b>Footnote 9:</b><a href="#footnotetag9">
(return) </a> This is a partly paraphrastic and conjectural translation of a very
obscure sentence of Jordanes.</blockquote>

<p>The three Ostrogothic brethren, kings towards
their own countrymen, were subjects--almost, we
might say, servants--of the wide-ruling king of the
Huns, who was now no longer one of those forgotten
chiefs by whom the conquering tribe had been first
led into Europe, but ATTILA, a name of fear to his
contemporaries and long remembered in the Roman
world. He, with his brother Bleda, mounted the
<a name="p20" id="p20"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 20</span>
barbarian throne in the year 433, and after twelve
years the death of Bleda (who was perhaps murdered
by order of his brother) left Attila sole wielder of
the forces which made him the terror of the world.
He dwelt in rude magnificence in a village not far
from the Danube, and his own special dominions
seem to have pretty nearly corresponded with the
modern kingdom of Hungary. But he held in leash
a vast confederacy of nations--Teutonic, Sclavonic,
and what we now call Turanian,--whose territories
stretched from the Rhine to the Caucasus, and he is
said to have made "the isles of the Ocean", which
expression probably denotes the islands and peninsulas
of Scandinavia, subject to his sway. Neither,
however, over the Ostrogoths nor over any of the
other subject nations included in this vast dominion
are we to think of Attila's rule as an organised, all-permeating,
assimilating influence, such as was the
rule of a Roman Emperor. It was rather the influence
of one great robber-chief over his freebooting
companions. The kings of the Ostrogoths and
Gepidæ came at certain times to share the revelries
of their lord in his great log-palace on the Danubian
plain; they received his orders to put their subjects
in array when he would ride forth to war, and woe
was unto them if they failed to stand by his side on
the day of battle; but these things being done, they
probably ruled their own peoples with little interference
from their over-lord. The Teutonic members
of the confederacy, notably the Ostrogoths and the
kindred tribe of Gepidæ seem to have exercised
upon the court and the councils of Attila an influence
<a name="p21" id="p21"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 21</span>
not unlike that wielded by German statesmen
at the court of Russia during the last century.
The Huns, during their eighty years of contact with
Europe, had lost a little of that utter savageness
which they brought with them from the Tartar
deserts. If they were not yet in any sense civilised,
they could in some degree appreciate the higher
civilisation of their Teutonic subjects. A Pagan
himself, with scarcely any religion except some rude
cult of the sword of the war-god, Attila seems never
to have interfered in the slightest degree with the
religious practices of the Gepidæ or the Ostrogoths,
the large majority of whom were by this time Christians,
holding the Arian form of faith. And not
only did he not discourage the finer civilisation
which he saw prevailing among these German subjects
of his, but he seems to have had statesmanship
enough to value and respect a culture which he did
not share, and especially to have prized the temperate
wisdom of their chiefs, when they helped him to
array his great host of barbarians for war against the
Empire.</p>

<p>From his position in Central Europe, Attila, like
Alaric before him, was able to threaten either the
Eastern or the Western Empire at pleasure. For
almost ten years (440-450) he seemed to be bent on
picking a quarrel with Theodosius II., the feeble and
unwarlike prince who reigned at Constantinople.
He laid waste the provinces south of the Danube
with his desolating raids; he worried the Imperial
Court with incessant embassies, each more exacting
and greedy than the last (for the favour of the rude
<a name="p22" id="p22"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 22</span>
Hunnish envoy had to be purchased by large gifts
from the Imperial Treasury); he himself insisted on
the payment of yearly <i>stipendia</i> by the Emperor; he
constantly demanded that these payments should be
doubled; he openly stated that they were nothing
else than tribute, and that the Roman Augustus who
paid them was his slave.</p>

<p>These practices were continued until, in the year
450 the gentle Theodosius died. He was succeeded
by his sister Pulcheria and her husband Marcian,
who soon gave a manlier tone to the counsels of the
Eastern Empire. Attila marked the change and
turned his harassing attentions to the Western State,
with which he had always a sufficient number of
pretexts for war ready for use. In fact he had made
up his mind for war, and no concessions, however
humiliating, on the part of Valentinian III., the then
Emperor of the West, would have availed to stay
his progress. Not Italy however, to some extent
protected by the barrier of the Alps, but the rich
cities and comparatively unwasted plains of Gaul
attracted the royal freebooter. Having summoned
his vast and heterogeneous army from every quarter
of Central and North-eastern Europe, and surrounded
himself by a crowd of subject kings, the captains of his
host, he set forward in the spring of 451 for the lands
of the Rhine. The trees which his soldiers felled in
the great Hercynian forest of Central Germany were
fashioned into rude rafts or canoes, on which they
crossed the Rhine; and soon the terrible Hun and
his "horde of many-nationed spoilers" were passing
over the regions which we now call Belgium and
<a name="p23" id="p23"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 23</span>
Lorraine in a desolating stream. The Huns, not
only barbarians, but heathens, seem in this invasion
to have been animated by an especial hatred to
Christianity. Many a fair church of Gallia Belgica
was laid in ashes: many a priest was slain before the
altar, whose sanctity was vain for his protection.
The real cruelties thus committed are wildly exaggerated
by the mythical fancy of the Middle Ages,
and upon the slenderest foundations of historical
fact arose stately edifices of fable, like the story
of the Cornish Princess Ursula, who with her eleven
thousand virgin companions was fabled to have
suffered death at the hands of the Huns in the city
of Cologne.</p>

<p>The barbarian tide was at length arrested by the
strong walls of Orleans, whose stubborn defence
saved all that part of Gaul which lies within the
protecting curve of the Loire from the horrors of
their invasion. At midsummer Attila and his host
were retiring from the untaken city, and beginning
their retreat towards the Rhine, a retreat which they
were not to accomplish unhindered. The extremity
of the danger from these utterly savage foes had
welded together the old Empire and the new Gothic
kingdom, the civilised and the half-civilised power, in
one great confederacy, for the defence of all that
was worth saving in human society. The tidings of
the approach of the Gothic king had hastened the
departure of Attila from the environs of Orleans,
and, perhaps about a fortnight later, the allied
armies of Romans and Goths came up with the
retreating Huns in "the Catalaunian plains" not far
<a name="p24" id="p24"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 24</span>
from the city of Troyes. The general of the Imperial
army was Aëtius; the general and king of the
Visigoths was Theodoric, a namesake of our hero.
Both were capable and valiant soldiers. On the
other side, conspicuous among the subject kings who
formed the staff of Attila, were the three Ostrogothic
brethren, and Ardaric, king of the Gepidæ.
The loyalty of Walamir, the firm grasp with which
he kept his master's secrets, and Ardaric's resourcefulness
in counsel were especially prized by Attila.
And truly he had need of all their help, for, though
it is difficult to ascertain with any degree of accuracy
the numbers actually engaged (162,000 are said to
have fallen on both sides), it is clear that this was a
collision of nations rather than of armies, and that it
required greater skill than any that the rude Hunnish
leader possessed, to win the victory for his
enormous host. After "a battle ruthless, manifold,
gigantic, obstinate, such as antiquity never described
when she told of warlike deeds, such as no man who
missed the sight of that marvel might ever hope to
have another chance of beholding",<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a>
<a href="#footnote10"><sup class="sml">10</sup></a> night fell upon
the virtually defeated Huns. The Gothic king had
lost his life, but Attila had lost the victory. All
night long the Huns kept up a barbarous dissonance
to prevent the enemy from attacking them, but their
king's thoughts were of suicide. He had prepared a
huge funeral pyre, on which, if the enemy next day
successfully attacked his camp, he was determined to
slay himself amid the kindled flames, in order that
neither living nor dead the mighty Attila might fall
<a name="p25" id="p25"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 25</span>
into the hands of his enemies. These desperate expedients,
however, were not required. The death of
Theodoric, the caution of Aëtius, some jealousy
perhaps between the Roman and the Goth, some
anxiety on the part of the eldest Gothic prince as to
the succession to his father's throne,--all these causes
combined to procure for Attila a safe but closely
watched return into his own land.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote10"
name="footnote10"></a><b>Footnote 10:</b><a href="#footnotetag10">
(return) </a> These are the words of the Gothic historian, Jordanes.</blockquote>

<p>The battle of the Catalaunian plains (usually but
not quite correctly called the battle of Châlons) was
a memorable event in the history of the Gothic race,
of Europe, and of the world. It was a sad necessity
which on this one occasion arrayed the two great
branches of the Gothic people, the Visigoths under
Theodoric, and the Ostrogoths under Walamir, in
fratricidal strife against each other. For Europe the
alliance between Roman and Goth, between the
grandson of Theodosius, Emperor of Rome, and the
successor of Alaric, the besieger of Rome, was of
priceless value and showed that the great and statesmanlike
thought of Ataulfus was ripening in the
minds of those who came after him. For the world,
yes even for us in the nineteenth century, and for the
great undiscovered continents beyond the sea, the
repulse of the squalid and unprogressive Turanian
from the seats of the old historic civilisation, was
essential to the preservation of whatever makes
human life worth living. Had Attila conquered on
the Catalaunian plains, an endless succession of
Jenghiz Khans and Tamerlanes would probably
have swept over the desolated plains of Europe;
Paris and Florence would have been even as Khiva
<a name="p26" id="p26"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 26</span>
and Bokhara, and the island of Britain would not
have yet attained to the degree of civilisation reached
by the peninsula of Corea.</p>

<p>In the year after the fruitless invasion of Gaul, Attila
crossed the Julian Alps and entered Italy, intending
(452) doubtless to rival the fame of Alaric by his
capture of Rome, an operation which would
have been attended with infinitely greater ruin to<br><br>

"the seven-hilled city's pride",<br><br>

than any which she had sustained at the hands of the
Visigothic leader. But the Huns, unskilful in siege
work, were long detained before the walls of Aquileia,
that great and flourishing frontier city, hitherto
deemed impregnable, which gathered in the wealth
of the Venetian province, and guarded the north-eastern
approaches to Italy. At length by a sudden
assault they made themselves masters of the city,
which they destroyed with utter destruction, putting
all the inhabitants to the sword, and then wrapping
in fire and smoke the stately palaces, the wharves,
the mint, the forum, the theatres of the fourth city
of Italy. The terror of this brutal destruction took
from the other cities of Venetia all heart for resistance
to the terrible invader. From Concordia,
Altino, Padua, crowds of trembling fugitives walked,
waded, or sailed with their hastily gathered and most
precious possessions to the islands, surrounded by
shallow lagoons, which fringed the Adriatic coast,
near the mouths of the Brenta and Adige. There at
Torcello, Burano, Rialto, Malamocco, and their
sister islets, they laid the humble foundations of
<a name="p27" id="p27"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 27</span>
that which was one day to be the gorgeous and wide-ruling
Republic of Venice.</p>

<p>Attila meanwhile marched on through the valley of
the Po ravaging and plundering, but a little slackening
in the work of mere destruction, as the remembrance
of the stubborn defence of Aquileia faded
from his memory. Entering Milan as a conqueror,
and seeing there a picture representing the Emperors
of the Romans sitting on golden thrones, and the
Scythian barbarians crouching at their feet, he sought
out a Milanese painter, and bade the trembling artist
represent him, Attila, sitting on the throne, and the
two Roman Emperors staggering under sacks full of
gold coin, which they bore upon their shoulders, and
pouring out their precious contents at his feet.</p>

<p>This little incident helps us to understand the
next strange act in the drama of Attila's invasion.
To enjoy the luxury of humbling the great Empire,
and of trampling on the pride of her statesmen,
seems to have been the sweetest pleasure of his life.
This mere gratification of his pride, the pride of an
upstart barbarian, at the expense of the inheritors of
a mighty name and the representatives of venerable
traditions, was the object which took him into Italy,
rather than any carefully prepared scheme of worldwide
conquest. Accordingly when that august body,
the Senate of Rome, sent a consul, a prefect, and more
than all a pope, the majestic and fitly-named Leo, to
plead humbly in the name of the Roman people for
peace, and to promise acquiescence at some future
day in the most unreasonable of his demands, Attila
granted the ambassadors an interview by the banks
<a name="p28" id="p28"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 28</span>
of the Mincio, listened with haughty tranquillity to
their petition, allowed himself to be soothed and, as
it were, magnetised by the words and gestures of the
venerable pontiff, accepted the rich presents which
were doubtless laid at his feet, and turning his face
homewards recrossed the Julian Alps, leaving the
Apennines untraversed and Rome unvisited.</p>

<p>Even in the act of granting peace Attila used words
which showed that it would be only a truce, and that
(452) if there were any failure to abide by any one
of his conditions, he would return and work
yet greater mischief to Italy than any which she had
yet suffered at his hands. But he had missed the
fateful moment, and the delight of standing on the
conquered Palatine, and seeing the smoke ascend from
the ruined City of the World, was never to be his.
In the year after his invasion of Italy he died suddenly
at night, apparently the victim of the drunken
debauch with which the polygamous barbarian had
celebrated the latest addition to the numerous company
of his wives.</p>

<p>With Attila's death the might of the Hunnish
Empire was broken. The great robber-camp needed
the ascendancy of one strong chief-robber to hold it
together, and that ascendancy no one of the multitudinous
sons who emerged from the chambers of
his harem was able to exert. Unable to agree as to
the succession of the throne, they talked of dividing
the Hunnish dominions between them, and in the
discussions which ensued they showed too plainly
that they looked upon the subject nations as their
slaves, to be partitioned as a large household of such
<a name="p29" id="p29"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 29</span>
domestics would be partitioned among the heirs of
their dead master. The pride of the Teutons was
touched, and they determined to strike a blow for
the recovery of their lost freedom. Ardaric, king
of the Gepidæ, so long the trusty counsellor of
Attila, was prime mover in the revolt against his
sons. A battle was fought by the banks of the river
Nedao<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a>
<a href="#footnote11"><sup class="sml">11</sup></a> between the Huns (with those subject allies
who still remained faithful to them) and the revolted
nations.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote11"
name="footnote11"></a><b>Footnote 11:</b><a href="#footnotetag11">
(return) </a> Situation unknown, except that it was in Pannonia, that is, probably
in Hungary, somewhere between the Save and the Danube.</blockquote>

<p>Among these revolted nations there can be but
little doubt that the Ostrogoths held a high place,
though the matter is not so clearly stated as we
should have expected, by the Gothic historian, and
even on his showing the glory of the struggle for independence
was mainly Ardaric's. After a terrible
battle the Gepidæ were victorious, and Ellak, eldest
son of Attila, with, it is said, thirty thousand of his
soldiers, lay dead upon the field. "He had wrought
a great slaughter of his enemies, and so glorious was
his end", says Jordanes, "that his father might well
have envied him his manner of dying".</p>

<p>The battle of Nedao, whatever may have been the
share of the Ostrogoths in the actual fighting, certainly
brought them freedom. From this time the
great Hunnish Empire was at an end, and there was
a general resettlement of territory among the nations
which had been subject to its yoke. While the
Huns themselves, abandoning their former habitations,
moved, for the most part, down the Danube,
<a name="p30" id="p30"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 30</span>
and became the humble servants of the Eastern
Empire, the Gepidæ, perhaps marching southward
occupied the great Hungarian plains on the left
bank of the Danube, which had been the home of
Attila and his Huns; and the Ostrogoths going
westwards (perhaps with some dim notion of following
their Visigothic kindred) took up their abode in
that which had once been the Roman province of
Pannonia, now doubtless known to be hopelessly lost
to the Empire.</p>

<p>Pannonia, the new home of the Ostrogoths, was
the name of a region, rectangular in shape, about two
hundred miles from north to south and one hundred
and sixty miles from east to west, whose northern
and eastern sides were washed by the river Danube,
and whose north-eastern corner was formed by the
sudden bend to the south which that river makes, a
little above Buda-Pest. This region includes Vienna
and the eastern part of the Archduchy of Austria,
Grätz, and the eastern part of the Duchy of Styria,
but it is chiefly composed of the great corn-growing
plain of Western Hungary, and contains the two
considerable lakes of Balaton and Neusiedler See.
Here then the three Ostrogothic brethren took up
their abode, and of this province they made a kind of
rude partition between them, while still treating it as
one kingdom, of which Walamir was the head. The
precise details of this division of territory cannot
now be recovered,<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a>
<a href="#footnote12"><sup class="sml">12</sup></a> nor are they of much importance,
<a name="p31" id="p31"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 31</span>
as the settlement was of short duration. We can
only say that Walamir and Theudemir occupied the
two ends of the territory, and Widemir dwelt between
them. What is most interesting to us is the
fact that Theudemir's territory included Lake Balaton
(or Platten See), and that his palace may very
possibly have stood upon the shores of that noble
piece of water, which is forty-seven miles in length
and varies from three to nine miles in width. To
the neighbourhood of this lake, in the absence of
more precise information, we may with some probability
assign the birth-place and the childish home of
Theodoric.<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a>

<h3>THEODORIC'S BOYHOOD.</h3>

<p>Inroad of the Huns--Their defeat by Walamir--Birth of

of Constantinople--Its commerce and its monuments.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/018.png">he Ostrogoths had yet one or two
battles to fight before they were
quite rid of their old masters.
The sons of Attila still talked of
them as deserters and fugitive
slaves, and a day came when
Walamir found himself compelled
to face a sudden inroad of the
Huns. He had few men with him,
and being taken unawares, he had no time to summon
his brethren to his aid.
But he held his own
bravely: the warriors of his nation had time
to gather round him; and at last, after he
had long wearied the enemy with his defensive
tactics, he made a sudden onset, destroyed the
greater part of the Hunnish army, and sent the rest
<a name="p33" id="p33"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 33</span>
scattered in hopeless flight far into the deserts of
Scythia.<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote14"

(return) </a> Jordanes (cap. iii) says that the fugitive Huns "sought those
parts of Scythia past which flow the streams of the river Dnieper
which the Huns in their own tongue call 'Var' (the river)". If this
is correctly stated it is almost certain that it must describe some battle
which happened <i>before</i> the great Western migration of the Ostrogoths,
which was mentioned in the last chapter, for it would be impossible,
if the Gepidæ were in Trans-danubian Hungary and the Ostrogoths in
Pannonia that the Ostrogoths should have driven the Huns into the
countries watered by the Dnieper. I am rather inclined to believe
that this reference of the battle to an earlier period may be the correct
explanation. But Danapri (Dnieper) may be only a blunder of
Jordanes, who is often hopelessly wrong in his geography.</blockquote>

<p>Walamir at once sent tidings of the victory to his
brother Theudemir. The messenger arrived at an
opportune moment, for on that very day Erelieva,
the unwedded wife of Theudemir, had given birth to
a man-child. This infant, born on such an auspicious
day and looked upon as a pledge of happy fortunes
for the Ostrogothic nation, was named Thiuda-reiks
(the people-ruler), a name which Latin historians,
influenced perhaps by the analogy of Theodosius,
changed into Theodoricus, and which will here be
spoken of under the well-known form THEODORIC.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a>
<a href="#footnote15"><sup class="sml">15</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote15"
name="footnote15"></a><b>Footnote 15:</b><a href="#footnotetag15">
(return) </a> Jordanes wavers between Theod<i>e</i>ricus and Theod<i>o</i>ricus. The
Greek historians generally use the form θευδερίχος. German scholars
seem to prefer Theoderich. As it is useless now to try to revert
to the philologically correct Thiuda-reiks, I use that form of the name
with which I suppose English readers to be most familiar--namely,
Theodoric.</blockquote>

<p>It will be observed that I have spoken of Erelieva
as the unwedded wife of Theudemir. The Gothic
historian calls her his concubine,<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a>
<a href="#footnote16"><sup class="sml">16</sup></a> but this word of
<a name="p34" id="p34"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 34</span>
reproach hardly does justice to her position. In
many of the Teutonic nations, as among the Norsemen
of a later century, there seems to have been a
certain laxity as to the marriage rite, which was
nevertheless coincident with a high and pure morality.
It has been suggested that the severe conditions
imposed by the Church on divorces may have
had something to do with the peculiar marital usages
of the Teutonic and Norse chieftains. Reasons of
state might require Theudemir the Ostrogoth, or
William Longsword the Norman, to ally himself
some day with a powerful king's daughter, and therefore
he would not go through the marriage rite with
the woman, really and truly his wife, but generally
his inferior in social position, who meanwhile governed
his house and bore him children. If the
separation never came, and the powerful king's
daughter never had to be wooed, she who was wife
in all but name, retained her position unquestioned
till her death, and her children succeeded without
dispute to the inheritance of their father. The
nearest approach to an illustration which the social
usages of modern Europe afford, is probably furnished
by the "morganatic marriages" of modern
German royalties and serenities: and we might say
that Theodoric was the offspring of such an union.
Notwithstanding the want of strict legitimacy in his
position, I do not remember any occasion on which
the taunt of bastard birth was thrown in his teeth,
even by the bitterest of his foes.</p>

<p>It would be satisfactory if we could fix with exactness
the great Ostrogoth's birth-year, but though
<a name="p35" id="p35"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 35</span>
several circumstances point to 454 as a probable date,
we are not able to define it with greater precision.<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a>

<p>The next event of which we are informed in the
history of the Ostrogothic nation, a war with the
Eastern Empire, was one destined to exert a most
important influence on the life of the kingly child,
The Ostrogoths settling in Pannonia, one of the
provinces of the Roman Empire, were in theory
allies and auxiliary soldiers<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a>
<a href="#footnote18"><sup class="sml">18</sup></a> of the Emperor. Similar
arrangements had been made with the Visigoths
in Spain, with the Vandals in that very province of
Pannonia, probably with many other barbarian tribes
in many other provinces. There was sometimes
more, sometimes less, actual truth in the theoretical
relations thus established, and it was one which in
the nature of things was not likely long to endure:
but for the time, so long as the Imperial treasury
was tolerably full and the barbarian allies tolerably
amenable to control, the arrangement suited both
parties. In the case before us the position of the
Ostrogoths in Pannonia was legalised by the alliance,
and such portions of the political machinery of the
Empire as might still remain were thereby placed at
their disposal. The Emperor, on the other hand,
was able to boast of a province recovered for the
Empire, which was now guarded by the broadswords
of his loyal Ostrogoths against the more savage
nations outside, who were ever trying to enter the
<a name="p36" id="p36"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 36</span>
charmed circle of the Roman State. But as the
Ostrogothic <i>fœderati</i> were his soldiers, there was
evidently a necessity that he must send them pay,
and this pay, which was called wages when the Empire
was strong, and tribute when it was weak, consisted,
partly at any rate, of heavy chests of Imperial
<i>aurei</i>,<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a>
<a href="#footnote19"><sup class="sml">19</sup></a> sent as <i>strenae</i><a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a>
<a href="#footnote20"><sup class="sml">20</sup></a> or New Year's presents, to
the barbarian king and his chief nobles.</p>

<p>Now, about the year 461, the Emperor Leo (successor
of the brave soldier Marcian), whether from a
special emptiness in the Imperial treasury or from
some other cause, omitted to send the accustomed
<i>strenae</i> to the Ostrogothic brother-kings. Much disturbed
at the failure of the <i>aurei</i> to appear, they sent
envoys to Constantinople, who returned with tidings
which filled the three palaces of Pannonia with the
clamour of angry men. Not only were the <i>strenae</i>
withheld, and likely to be still withheld, but there
was another Goth, a low-born pretender, not of Amal
blood, who was boasting of the title of <i>fœderatus</i> of
the Empire, and enjoying the <i>strenae</i> which ought to
come only to Amal kings and their nobles. This man,
who was destined to cross the path of our Theodoric
through many weary years, was named like him
Theodoric, and was surnamed Strabo (the squinter)
from his devious vision, and son of Triarius, from his
parentage. He was brother-in-law, or nephew, of a
certain Aspar, a successful barbarian, who had
mounted high in the Imperial service and had placed
two Emperors on the throne. It was doubtless
<a name="p37" id="p37"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 37</span>
through his kinsman's influence that the squinting
adventurer had obtained a position in the court of
the Roman Augustus so disproportioned to his birth,
and so outrageous to every loyal Ostrogoth.</p>

<p>When the news of these insults to the lineage of
the Amals reached Pannonia, the three brothers in
fury snatched up their arms and laid waste almost
the whole province of Illyricum. Then the Emperor
changed his mind, and desired to renew the old
friendship. He sent an embassy bearing the arrears
of the past-due <i>strenae</i>, those which were then again
falling due, and a promise that all future <i>strenae</i>
should be punctually paid. Only, as a hostage for
the observance of peace he desired that Theudemir's
little son, Theodoric, then just entering
his eighth year, should be sent to Constantinople.
The fact that this request or demand was made by
the ostensibly beaten side, may make us doubt
whether the humiliation of the Empire was so complete
as the preceding sentences (translated from
the words of the Gothic historian) would lead us to
suppose.</p>

<p>Theudemir was reluctant to part with his first-born
son, even to the great Roman Emperor. But his
brother Walamir earnestly besought him not to interpose
any hindrance to the establishment of a firm
peace between the Romans and Goths. He yielded
therefore, and the little lad, carried by the returning
ambassadors to Constantinople, soon earned the
favour of the Emperor by his handsome face and his
winning ways.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a>

<p>Thus was the young Ostrogoth brought from his
home in Pannonia, by the banks of lonely Lake
Balaton, to the New Rome, the busy and stately
city by the Bosphorus, the city which was now,
more truly than her worn and faded mother by the
Tiber, the "Lady of Kingdoms" the "Mistress of
the World". Of the Constantinople which the boyish
eyes of Theodoric beheld, scarcely a vestige now
remains for the traveller to gaze upon. Let us try,
therefore, to find a contemporary description. These
are the words in which the visit of the Gothic chief
Athanaric to that city about eighty years previously
is described by Jordanes:</p>

<p>"Entering the royal city, and marvelling thereat,
'Lo! now I behold,' said he, 'what I often heard of
without believing, the glory of so great a city.'
Then turning his eyes this way and that, beholding
the situation of the city and the concourse of ships,
now he marvels at the long perspective of lofty walls,
then he sees the multitudes of various nations like
the wave gushing forth from one fountain which has
been fed by divers springs, then he beholds the
marshalled ranks of the soldiery. 'A God,' said he,
'without doubt a God upon Earth is the Emperor of
this realm, and whoso lifts his hand against him, that
man's blood be on his own head"</p>

<p>Still can we behold "the situation of the city",
that unrivalled situation which no map can adequately
explain, but which the traveller gazes upon
from the deck of his vessel as he rounds Seraglio
Point, and the sight of which seems to bind together
in one, two continents of space and twenty-five centuries
<a name="p39" id="p39"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 39</span>
of time. On his right hand Asia with her
camels, on his left Europe with her railroads. Behind
him are the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles,
with their memories of Lysander and
Ægospotami, of Hero, Leander, and Byron, with
the throne of Xerxes and the tomb of Achilles, and
farther back still the island-studded Archipelago, the
true cradle of the Greek nation. Immediately in
front of him is the Golden Horn, now bridged and
with populous cities on both its banks, but the farther
shore of which, where Pera and Galata now
stand, was probably covered with fields and gardens
when Theodoric beheld it. There also in front of
him, but a little to the right, comes rushing down
the impetuous Bosphorus, that river which is also
an arm of the sea. Lined now with the marble
palaces of bankrupt Sultans, it was once a lonely and
desolate strait, on whose farther shore the hapless Io,
transformed into a heifer, sought a refuge from her
heaven-sent tormentor. Up through its difficult windings
pressed the adventurous mariners of Miletus
in those early voyages which opened up the Euxine
to the Greeks, as the voyage of Columbus opened
up the Atlantic to the Spaniards. It is impossible
now to survey the beautiful panorama without thinking
of that great inland sea which, as we all know,
begins but a few miles to the north of the place
where we are standing, and whose cloudy shores are
perhaps concealing in their recesses the future lords
of Constantinople. We look towards that point of
the compass, and think of Sebastopol. The great
lords of Theudemir's court, who brought the young

<a name="p40" id="p40"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 40</span>
Theodoric to his new patron, may have looked
northwards too, remembering the sagas about the
mighty Hermanric, who dwelt where now the Russians
dwell, and the fateful march of the terrible
Huns across the shallows of the Sea of Azof.</p>

<p>The great physical features of the scene are of
course unchanged, but almost everything else, how
changed by four centuries and a half of Ottoman
domination! The first view of Stamboul, with its
mosques, its minarets, its latticed houses, its stream
of manifold life both civilised and barbarous, flowing
through the streets, is delightful to the traveller;
but if he be more of an archaeologist than an artist,
and seeks to reproduce before his mind's eye something
of the Constantinople of the Cæsars rather
than the Stamboul of the Sultans, he will experience
a bitter disappointment in finding how little of the
former is left.</p>

<p>He may still see indeed the land-ward walls of the
city, and a most interesting historical relic they are.<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a>
<a href="#footnote22"><sup class="sml">22</sup></a>
They stretch for about four miles, from the Sea of
Marmora to the Golden Horn. It is still, comparatively
speaking, all city inside of them, all country
on the outside. There is a double line of walls with
towers at frequent intervals, some square, some octagonal,
and deep fosses running along beside the
<a name="p41" id="p41"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 41</span>
walls, now in spring often bright green with growing
corn. These walls and towers, seen stretching up
hill and down dale, are a very notable feature in the
landscape, and ruinous and dismantled as they are
after fourteen centuries of siege, of earthquake, and
of neglect, they still help us vividly to imagine what
they must have looked like when the young Theodoric
beheld them little more than ten years after
their erection.<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a>

good offices of a recent British ambassador, I believe Lord Stratford

from her son an order to pull down the walls, and sell the materials
for the benefit of her privy purse. The ambassador, however, protested
against this act of Ottomanism (rather than Vandalism), and
the walls were saved.</blockquote>

<p>Of the gates, some six or seven in number, two
are especially interesting to us. The first is the Tep-Kapou
(Cannon Gate), or Porta Sancti Romani.
This was the weakest part of the fortifications of
Constantinople, the "heel of Achilles", as it has been
well called,<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a>
<a href="#footnote24"><sup class="sml">24</sup></a> and here the last Roman Emperor of the
East, Constantine Palaeologus, died bravely in the
breach for the cause of Christianity and civilisation,
The other gate is the Porta Aurea, a fine triple gateway,
the centre arch of which rests on two Corinthian
pilasters. Through this gateway--the nearest
representative of the Capitoline Hill at Rome--the
Eastern Emperors rode in triumphant procession
when a new Augustus had to be proclaimed, or when
an enemy of the Republic had been defeated. It is
possible that Theodoric may have seen Anthemius,
the Emperor whom Constantinople gave to Rome,
ride forth through this gate (467) to take possession
<a name="p42" id="p42"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 42</span>
of the Western throne: possible too that the great
but unsuccessful expedition planned by the joint
forces of the East and West against the Vandals of
Africa may have had its ignominious failure hidden
from the people for a time by a triumphal procession
through the Golden Gate in the following year (468).
This gate is now walled up, and tradition says that
the order for its closure was given by Mohammed,
the Conqueror, immediately after his entry into the
city, through fear of an old Turkish prophecy, which
declared that through this gate the next conquerors
should enter Constantinople.</p>

<p>Of the palace of the Emperor, into which the young
Goth was ushered by the eunuch-chamberlain, no
vestige probably now remains. The Seraglio has
replaced the Palation, and is itself now abandoned
to loneliness and decay, being only the recipient of
one annual visit from the Sultan, when he goes in
state to kiss the cloak of Mohammed. The great
mosque of St. Sophia on the right is a genuine and
a glorious monument of Imperial Constantinople,
but not of Constantinople as Theodoric saw it. The
basilica, in which he probably listened with childish
bewilderment to many a sermon for or against the
decrees of the council of Chalcedon, was burnt down
sixty years after his visit in the great Insurrection
of the "Nika", and the noble edifice in which ten
thousand Mussulmans now assemble to listen to the
reading of the Koran, while above them the Arabic
names of the companions of the Prophet replace the
mosaics of the Evangelists, is itself the work of the
great Emperor Justinian, the destroyer of the State
which Theodoric founded.</p>

<a name="p43" id="p43"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 43</span>
<p>But almost between the Church of St. Sophia and
the Imperial Palace lay in old times the Great Hippodrome,
centre of the popular life of the capital,
where the excited multitudes cheered with rapture,
or howled in execration, at the victory of the Blue or
the Green charioteer; where many a time the elevation
or the deposition of an Emperor was accomplished
by the acclamations of the same roaring
throng. Of this Hippodrome we have still a most
interesting memorial in the Atmeidan (the Place of
Horses), which, though with diminished area, still
preserves something of the form of the old racecourse.
And here to this day are two monuments
on which the young hostage may have often gazed,
wondering at their form and meaning. The obelisk
of Thothmes I., already two thousand years old
when Constantinople was founded, was reared in the
Hippodrome, by order of the great Emperor Theodosius,
and some of the bas-reliefs on its pedestal
still explain to us the mechanical devices by which
it was lifted into position, while in others Theodosius,
his wife, his sons, and his colleague sit in solemn
state, but, alas! with grievously mutilated countenances.
Near it is a spiral column of bronze which,
almost till our own day, bore three serpents twined
together, whose heads long ago supported a golden
tripod. This bronze monument is none other than
the votive offering to the temple of Apollo at Delphi,
presented by the confederated states of Greece, to
celebrate the victory of Platæa. The golden tripod
was melted down at the time of Philip of Macedon,
but the twisted serpents, brought by Constantine to
adorn and hallow his new capital by the Bosphorus,
<a name="p44" id="p44"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 44</span>
bore and still bear the names, written in archaic
characters, of all the Hellenic states which took part
in that great deliverance.</p>

<p>All these monuments are on the first of the seven
hills on which Constantinople is built. On the
second hill stands a strange and blackened pillar,
which once stood in the middle of the Forum of Constantine;
and this too was there in the days of
Theodoric. It is called the Burnt Column, because
it has been more than once struck by lightning, and
is blackened with the smoke of the frequent fires
which have consumed the wooden shanties at its
base. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">    "there it stands, as stands a lofty mind,</p>
<p>Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd".</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was once 150 feet high, but is now 115, and it
consists of six huge cylinders of porphyry, one above
another, whose junction is veiled by sculptured
laurel wreaths. On its summit stood the statue of
Constantine with the garb and attributes of the
Grecian Sun-God, but having his head surrounded
with the nails of the True Cross, brought from Jerusalem
to serve instead of the golden rays of far-darting
Apollo. Underneath the column was placed (and
remains probably to this day) the Palladium, that
mysterious image of Minerva, which Æneas carried
from Troy to Alba Longa, which his descendants
removed to Rome, and which was now brought by
Constantine to his new capital, so near to its first
legendary home, to be the pledge of abiding security
to the city by the Bosphorus.</p>

<a name="p45" id="p45"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 45</span>
<p>These are the chief relics of Constantinople in the
fifth century which are still visible to the traveller.
I have described with some little detail the outward
appearance of the city and its monuments, because
these would naturally be the objects which would
most attract the attention of a child brought from
such far different scenes into the midst of so stately
a city. But during the ten or eleven years that Theodoric
remained in honourable captivity at the court of
Leo, while he was growing up from childhood to
manhood, it cannot be doubted that he gradually
learned the deeper lessons which lay below the glory
and the glitter of the great city's life, and that the
knowledge thus acquired in those years which are so
powerful in moulding character, had a mighty influence
on all his subsequent career.</p>

<p>He saw here for the first time, and by degrees he
apprehended, the results of that state of <i>civilitas</i>
which in after years he was to be constantly recommending
to his people. Sprung from a race of hunters
and shepherds, having slowly learned the arts of
agriculture, and then perhaps partly unlearned them
under the over-lordship of the nomad Huns, the
Ostrogoths at this time knew nothing of a city life.
A city was probably in their eyes little else than a
hindrance to their freebooting raids, a lair of enemies,
a place behind whose sheltering walls, so hard to
batter down, cowards lurked in order to sally forth at
a favourable moment and attack brave men in their
rear. At best it was a treasure-house, which valiant
Goths, if Fortune favoured them, might sack and
plunder: but Fortune seldom did favour the children
<a name="p46" id="p46"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 46</span>
of Gaut in their assaults upon the fenced cities of the
Empire.</p>

<p>Now, however, the lad Theodoric began to perceive,
as the man Ataulfus had perceived before him, that
the city life upon which all the proverbs and the
songs of his countrymen poured contempt, had its
advantages. To the New Rome came the incessant
ships of Alexandria, bringing corn for the sustenance
of her citizens. Long caravans journeyed over the
highlands of Asia Minor loaded with the spices and
jewels of India and the silks of China. Men of every
conceivable Asiatic country were drawn by the irresistible
attraction of hoped-for profit to the quays
and the Fora of Byzantium. The scattered homesteads
of the Ostrogothic farmers had no such wonderful
power of drawing men over thousands of miles
of land and sea to visit them. Then the bright and
varied life of the Imperial City could not fail to fill the
boy's soul with pleasure and admiration. The thrill
of excitement in the Hippodrome as the two charioteers,
Green and Blue, rounded the <i>spina</i>, neck and
neck, the tragedies acted in the theatre amid rapturous
applause, the strange beasts from every part of
the Roman world that roared and fought in the
Amphitheatre, the delicious idleness of the Baths,
the chatter and bargaining and banter of the Forum,--all
this made a day in beautiful Constantinople very
unlike a day in the solemn and somewhat rude palace
by Lake Balaton.</p>

<p>As the boy grew to manhood, the deep underlying
cause of this difference perhaps became clearer
to his mind. He could see more or less plainly that
<a name="p47" id="p47"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 47</span>
the soul which held all this marvellous body of civilisation
together was reverence for Law. He visited
perhaps some of the courts of law; he may have
seen the Illustrious Prætorian Prefect, clothed in
Imperial purple, move majestically to the judgment-seat,
amid the obsequious salutations of the
dignified officials,<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a>
<a href="#footnote25"><sup class="sml">25</sup></a> who in their various ranks and
orders surrounded the hall. The costly golden reed-case,
the massive silver inkstand, the silver bowl for
the petitions of suitors, all emblems of his office,
were placed solemnly before him, and the pleadings
began. Practised advocates arose to plead the cause
of plaintiff or defendant; busy short-hand writers
took notes of the proceedings; at length in calm
and measured words the Prefect gave his judgment;
a judgment which was necessarily based on law,
which had to take account of the sayings of jurisconsults,
of the stored-up wisdom of twenty generations
of men; a judgment which, notwithstanding
the venality which was the curse of the Empire, was
in most instances in accordance with truth and justice.
How different, must Theodoric often have thought,
in after years, when he had returned to Gothland,--how
different was this settled and orderly procedure
from the usage of the barbarians. With them the
"blood-feud", the "wild justice of revenge", often
prolonged from generation to generation, had been
long the chief righter of wrongs done; and if this
was now slowly giving place to judicial trial, that
trial was probably a coarse and almost lawless proceeding,
in which the head man of the district, with
<a name="p48" id="p48"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 48</span>
a hundred assessors, as ignorant as himself, amid the
wild cries of the opposed parties, roughly fixed the
amount of blood-money to be paid by a murderer,
or decided at hap-hazard, often with an obvious reference
to the superior force at the command of one
or other of the litigants, some obscure dispute as to
the ownership of a slave or the right to succeed to
a dead man's inheritance.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote25"
name="footnote25"></a><b>Footnote 25:</b><a href="#footnotetag25">
(return) </a> Officium, or Militia Literata.</blockquote>

<p>Law carefully thought out, systematised, and in
the main softened and liberalised, from generation
to generation, was the great gift of the Roman Empire
to the world, and by her strong, and uniform,
and, in the main, just administration of this law, that
Empire had kept, and in the days of Theodoric was
still keeping, her hold upon a hundred jarring nationalities.
What hope was there that the German intruders
into the lands of the Mediterranean could
ever vie with this great achievement? Yet if they
could not, if it was out of their power to reform and
reinvigorate the shattered state, if they could only
destroy and not rebuild, they would exert no abiding
influence on the destinies of Europe.</p>

<p>I do not say that all these thoughts passed at this
time through the mind of Theodoric, but I have no
doubt that the germs of them were sown by his
residence in Constantinople. When he returned, a
young man of eighteen years and of noble presence
to the palace of his father, he had certainly some
conception of what the Greeks meant when he heard
them talking about <i>politeia</i>, some foreshadowing of
what he himself would mean when in after days he
should speak alike to his Goth and Roman subjects
of the blessings of <i>civilitas</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<h3>THE SOUTHWARD MIGRATION.</h3>

<p>Struggles with the Swabians, Sarmatians, Scyri, and Huns--Death of
Walamir--Theudemir becomes king--Theodoric defeats Babai--The
Teutonic custom of the comitatus--An Ostrogothic
Folc-mote--Theudemir invades the Eastern Empire--Macedonian
settlement of the Ostrogoths.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/020.png">he young Theodoric, who was
now in his nineteenth year, was
sent back by Leo to his father
with large presents, and both the
recovered son and the tokens of
Imperial favour brought joy to
the heart of the father. There
had been some changes in the
Ostrogothic kingdom during the
boy's absence. There had been vague and purposeless
wars with the savage nations around them,--Swabians,
Sarmatians, Scyri--besides one final encounter
with their old lords, the Huns. These last, we are told,
they had driven forth so hopelessly beaten from
<a name="p50" id="p50"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 50</span>
their territory, that for a century from that time all
that was left of the Hunnish nation trembled at the
very name of the Goths. But in a battle with another
people of far less renown, the barbarous Scyri
beyond the Danube, Walamir, while cheering on his
men to the combat, was thrown from his horse and
being pierced by the lances of the enemy was left
dead on the field. His death, it is said, was avenged
most ruthlessly on the Scyri, and Theudemir, the
brother who was next him in age, became chief king
of the Ostrogoths.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Theodoric returned to his home when,
without communicating his purpose to his father, he
distinguished himself by a gallant deed of arms. On
the south-east of the Ostrogothic kingdom, in the
country which we now call Servia, there reigned at
this time a Sclavonic chief called Babai, who was full
of pride and self-importance because of a victory
which he had lately gained over the forces of the
Empire. Theodoric had probably heard at Constantinople
the other side of this story: on his journey
to the north-west he had passed through those regions,
and marked the pride of the insolent barbarian.
Sympathy with the humiliated Empire, but, far
more, the young warrior's desire at once to find "a
foeman worthy of his steel", and to win laurels for
himself wherewith he might surprise his father, drove
him into his new enterprise. Having collected some
of his father's guardsmen, and those of his people
with whom he was personally popular, or who were
dependent upon him, he thus mustered a little army
of six thousand men, with whom he crossed the
<a name="p51" id="p51"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 51</span>
Danube.<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a>
<a href="#footnote26"><sup class="sml">26</sup></a> Falling suddenly upon King Babai, he defeated and slew him, took his family prisoners,and returned with large booty in slaves and the rude wealth of the barbarian to his surprised but joyful
father. The result of this expedition was the capture
of the important frontier city of Singidunum (whose
site is now occupied by Belgrade), a city which Babai
had wrested from the Empire, but which Theodoric,
whatever may have been his inclination to favour
Constantinople, did not deem it necessary to restore
to his late host.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote26"
name="footnote26"></a><b>Footnote 26:</b><a href="#footnotetag26">
(return) </a> The words of Jordanes (which are important on account of their bearing on the passage of Tacitus quoted below) are: "Ascitis certis ex satellitibus patris et ex populo amatores sibi clientesque consocians pæne sex mille viros cum quibus inscio patre emenso Danubio super Babai Sarmatarum regem discurrit" (Getica, lv.).</blockquote>

<p>This incident of the early manhood of Theodoric
is a good illustration of the Teutonic custom which
Tacitus describes to us under the name of the <i>comitatus</i>,
a custom which was therefore at least four
centuries old (probably far older) in the days of
Theodoric, and which, lasting on for several centuries
longer, undoubtedly influenced if it did not
actually create the chivalry of the Middle Ages.
The custom was so important that it will be better
to translate the very words of Tacitus concerning it,
though they occur in one of the best-known passages
of the "Germania".</p>

<p>"The Germans transact no business either of a
public or private nature except with arms in their
hands. But it is not the practice for any one to
begin the wearing of arms until the State has approved
his ability to wield them. When that is
<a name="p52" id="p52"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 52</span>
done, in the great Council of the nation one of the
chiefs, perhaps the father or some near relation of
the candidate, equips the youth with shield and
spear. This is with them like the <i>toga virilis</i> with
us, the first dignity bestowed on the young man.
Before this he was looked upon as part of his father's
household--now he is a member of the State. Eminently
noble birth, or great merit on the part of
their fathers, assigns the dignity of a chief<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a>
<a href="#footnote28"><sup class="sml">27</sup></a> even to
very young men. They are admitted to the fellowship
of other youths stronger than themselves, and
already tried in war, nor do they blush to be seen
among the henchmen.<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a>
<a href="#footnote28"><sup class="sml">28</sup></a> There is a gradation in rank among the henchmen, determined by the judgment of him whom they follow, and there is a great
emulation among the henchmen, who shall have
the highest place under the chief, and among the
chiefs who shall have the most numerous and the
bravest henchmen. This is their dignity, this their
strength, to be ever surrounded by a band of chosen
youths, an honour in peace, a defence in battle. And
not only in his own nation, but among the surrounding
states also, each chief's name and glory are
spread abroad according to the eminence of his
'train of henchmen'<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a>
<a href="#footnote29"><sup class="sml">29</sup></a> in number and valour. Chiefs thus distinguished are in request for embassies, are
<a name="p53" id="p53"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 53</span>
enriched with costly presents, and often they decide
a war by the mere terror of their name".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote27"

<p>"When they stand on the battle-field, it is held a
disgraceful thing for the chief to be surpassed in
bravery by his henchmen, for the henchmen not to
equal the valour of their chief. Now too it will
mark a man as infamous, and a target for the scorn
of men for all the rest of his life, if he escapes alive
from the battle-field where his chief needed his help.
To defend <i>him</i>, the chief; to guard <i>his</i> person; to
reckon up one's own brave deeds as enhancing <i>his</i>
glory: this is the henchman's one great oath of
fealty.<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a>
<a href="#footnote30"><sup class="sml">30</sup></a> The chiefs fight for victory, the henchmen for their chief. If the state in which they are born should be growing sluggish through ease and a long
peace, most of the noble young men seek of their
own accord those nations which are then waging war,
both because a quiet life is hateful to this people,
and because they can more easily distinguish themselves
in perilous times, nor can they keep together a
great train of henchmen, except by war and the strong
hand. For it is from the generosity of their chief that
each henchman expects that mighty war-horse which
he would bestride, that gory and victorious spear,
which he would brandish. Banquets, too, and all
the rough but plentiful appliances of the feast are
taken as part of the henchman's pay; and the means
of supplying all this prodigality must be sought by
war and rapine. You would not so easily persuade
them to plough the fields and wait in patience for a
year's harvest, as to challenge an enemy and earn
<a name="p54" id="p54"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 54</span>
honourable wounds; since to them it seems always a
slow and lazy process to accumulate by the sweat of
your brow what you might win at once by the shedding
of blood".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote30"
name="footnote30"></a><b>Footnote 30:</b><a href="#footnotetag30">
(return) </a> Præcipuum sacramentum.</blockquote>

<p>These words of Tacitus, written in the year 98 after
Christ, describe with wonderful exactness the state of
Ostrogothic society in the year 472. We are not expressly
told of Theodoric's assumption of the shield
and spear in the great Council of the nation, but
probably this ceremony immediately followed his return
from Constantinople. Then we see the gathering
together of the band of henchmen, the sudden
march away from the peaceful land, growing torpid
through two or three years of warlessness, the
surprise of the Sclavonic king, the copious effusion
of blood which was the preferred alternative to the
sweat of the land-tiller, the return to the young
chief's own land with spoils sufficient to support
perhaps for many months the "generosity" expected
by the henchmen.</p>

<p>There is one point, however, in which the description
of the Germans given by Tacitus is probably
not altogether applicable to the Goths of the fifth
century: and that is, their invincible preference for
the life of the warrior over that of the agriculturist.
There are some indications that the Germans, when
Tacitus wrote, had not long exchanged the nomadic
life of a nation of shepherds and herdsmen (such
as was led by the earlier generations of the Israelitish
people) for the settled life which alone is
consistent with the pursuits of the tiller of the soil.
Hence the roving instinct was still strong within
<a name="p55" id="p55"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 55</span>
them, and this roving instinct easily allied itself with
the thirst for battle and the love of the easy gains of
the freebooter. Four centuries, however, of agriculture
and of neighbourhood to the great civilised
stable Empire of Rome had apparently wrought
some change in the Goths and in many of the other
Teutonic nations. The work of agriculture was now
not altogether odious in their eyes; they knew something
of the joys of the husbandman as well as of the
joys of the warrior; they began to feel something of
that "land-hunger" which is the passion of a young,
growing, industrious people. Still, however, the
songs of the minstrels, the sagas of the bards, the
fiery impulses of the young <i>princeps</i> surrounded by
his <i>comitatus</i> pointed to war as the only occupation
worthy of freemen. Hence we can perceive a double
current in the ambitions of these nations which often
perplexes the historian now, as it evidently then
perplexed their mighty neighbour, the Roman Augustus,
and the generals and lawyers who counselled
him in his consistory. Sometimes the Teutonic king
is roused by some real or imagined insult; the minstrels
sing their battle-songs; the fiery henchmen
gather round their chief; the barbarian tide rolls
over the frontier of the Empire: it seems as if it

its implacable foes.   Then suddenly</p>

<p>Food, not glory, seems to be the supreme object of
the Teuton's ambition. He begs for land, for seed
<a name="p56" id="p56"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 56</span>
to sow in it, for a legal settlement within the limits
of the Empire. If only these necessary things are
granted to him, he promises, and not without intending
to keep his promise, to be a peaceable subject,
yes and a staunch defender, of the Roman Augustus.
Had the Imperial statesmen truly understood this
strange duality of purpose in the minds of their barbarian
visitors, and had they set themselves loyally
and patiently to foster the peaceful agricultural
instincts of the Teuton, haply the Roman Empire
might still be standing. As it was, the statesmen of
the day, men of temporary shifts and expedients,
living only as we say "from hand to mouth", saw,
in the changing moods of the Germans, only the
faithlessness of barbarism, which they met with the
faithlessness of civilisation, and between the two the
Empire--which no one really wished to destroy--was destroyed.</p>

<p>Even such a change it was which now came over
the minds of the Ostrogothic people. There was
dearth in Pannonia, partly, perhaps, the consequence
of the frequent wars with the surrounding nations
which had occurred during the twenty years of the
Ostrogothic settlement. But even the cessation of
those wars brought with it a loss of income to the
warrior class. As the Gothic historian expresses it:
"From the diminution of the spoils of the neighbouring
nations the Goths began to lack food and
clothing, and to those men to whom war had long
furnished all their sustenance peace began to be
odious, and all the Goths with loud shouts approached
their king Theudemir praying him to lead
<a name="p57" id="p57"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 57</span>
his army whither he would, but to lead it forth to
war".</p>

<p>Here again it can hardly be doubted that Jordanes,
writing about the fifth century, describes for us the
same state of things as Tacitus writing about the
first, and that this loudly shouted demand of the
people for war was expressed in one of those national
assemblies--the "Folc-motes" or "Folc-things" of
Anglo-Saxon and German history--which formed
such a real limitation to the power of the early Teutonic
kings. "Concerning smaller matters", says
Tacitus,<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a>
<a href="#footnote31"><sup class="sml">31</sup></a> "the chiefs
 deliberate; concerning greater matters, the whole nation; but in
 such wise that
even those things which are in the power of the commonalty
are discussed in detail by the chiefs. They
come together, unless any sudden and accidental
emergency have arisen, on fixed days determined by
the new or full moon; for these times they deem
the most fortunate for the transaction of business.
An ill consequence flowing from their freedom is
their want of punctuality in assembling; often two
or three days are spent in waiting for the loiterers.
When the crowd chooses, they sit down, arrayed in
their armour (and commence business). Silence is
called for by the priests, who have then the power
even of keeping order by force. Then the king or
one of the chiefs begins to speak, and is listened to
in right either of his age, or his noble birth, or his
glory in the wars, or his eloquence. In any case, he
rather persuades than commands; not power, but
weight of character procures the assent of his hearers.</p>

<p>If they mislike his sentiments they express their
contempt for them by groans, if they approve, they
clash their spears together. Applause thus expressed
by arms is the greatest tribute that can be paid to
a speaker".</p>

<p>Before such an assembly of the nation in arms, the
question, not of Peace or War? but of War with
whom? was debated. It was decided that the
Empire should be the victim, and that East and
West alike should feel the heavy hand of the Ostrogoths.
The lot was cast (so said the national legend),<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a>
<a href="#footnote32"><sup class="sml">32</sup></a>
and it assigned to Theudemir the harder but, as it
seemed, more profitable task of warring against Constantinople,
while his younger brother Widemir was
to attack Rome.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote32"
name="footnote32"></a><b>Footnote 32:</b><a href="#footnotetag32">
(return) </a> Kopke "Anfange des Konigthums", (p. 146) throws doubt on
this story of the decision by lot, and there seems something to be said on his side.</blockquote>

<p>Of Widemir's movements there is little to tell.
He died in Italy, not having apparently achieved
any brilliant exploits, and his son and namesake
was easily persuaded to turn aside into
Gaul, where he joined his forces to those of the
kindred Visigoths, and became absorbed in their
flourishing kingdom. This branch of Amal royalty
henceforward bears no fruit in history.</p>

<p>More important, at any rate in its ultimate consequences,
was the march of Theudemir and his people
into the dominions of the Eastern Cæsar.
They crossed the Save, and by their warlike
array terrified into acquiescence the Sclavonic tribes
which were settled in the neighbourhood of Belgrade.</p>

<a name="p59" id="p59"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 59</span>
<p>Having pushed up the valley of the Morava, they captured
the important city of Naissus (now Nisch), "the
first city of Illyricum". Here Theudemir tarried for a
space, sending on his son with a large and eager
<i>comitatus</i> farther up the valley of the Morava. They
reached the head of that valley, they crossed the
watershed and the plain of Kossova, and descended
the valley of the Vardar. Monastir in Macedonia,
Larissa in Thessaly were taken and sacked; and a
way having thus been made by these bold invaders
into the heart of the Empire, a message was sent to
Theudemir, inviting him to undertake the siege of
Thessalonica. Leaving a few guards in Naissus, the
old king moved southward with the bulk of his army,
and was soon standing with his men before the walls
of the Macedonian capital. The Patrician Hilarianus
held that city with a strong force, but when he saw it
regularly invested by the Goths and an earthen rampart
drawn all round it, he lost heart, and, despairing
of a successful resistance, opened negotiations with the
besiegers. The result of these negotiations (accompanied
by handsome presents to the king) was that
Theudemir abandoned the siege, resumed the often
adopted, perhaps never wholly abandoned, position
of a <i>fœderatus</i> or sworn auxiliary of the Empire, and
received for himself and his people the unquestioned
possession of six towns<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a>
<a href="#footnote33"><sup class="sml">33</sup></a> and the surrounding country
by the north-east corner of the Ægean, where the
Vardar discharges itself into the Thermaic Gulf.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote33"
name="footnote33"></a><b>Footnote 33:</b><a href="#footnotetag33">
(return) </a> The best known of these towns are Pella, Pydna, and Bercea.</blockquote>

<p>Thus ingloriously, thus unprofitably ended the
expedition into Romania, which had been proposed
<a name="p60" id="p60"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 60</span>
amid such enthusiastic applause at the great Council
of the nation, and pressed with such loud acclamations
and such brandishing of defiant spears upon the
perhaps reluctant Theudemir. The Ostrogoths in 472
were an independent people, practically supreme in
Pannonia. Those broad lands on the south and west
of the Danube, rich in corn and wine, the very kernel
of the Austrian monarchy of to-day, were theirs in
absolute possession. Any tie of nominal dependence
which attached Pannonia to the Empire was so
merely theoretical, now that the Hun had ruled and
ravaged it for a good part of a century, that it was
not worth taking into consideration; it was in fact
rather an excuse for claiming <i>stipendia</i> from the
Emperor than a bond of real vassalage. But now in
474 this great and proud nation, crowded into a few
cities of Macedonia, with obedient subjects of the
Empire all round them, had practically no choice
between the life of peaceful provincials on the one
hand and that of freebooters on the other. If they
accepted the first, they would lose year by year
something of their old national character. The
Teutonic speech, the Teutonic customs would gradually
disappear, and in one or two generations they
would be scarcely distinguishable from any of the
other oppressed, patient, tax-exhausted populations
of the great and weary Empire. On the other hand,
if they accepted (which in fact they seem to have
done) the other alternative, and became a mere horde
of plunderers wandering up and down through the
Empire, seeking what they might destroy, they abandoned
the hope of forming a settled and stable monarchy,
<a name="p61" id="p61"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 61</span>
and, doing injustice to the high qualities and
capacities for civilisation which were in them, they
would sink lower into the depths of barbarism, and
becoming like the Hun, like the Hun they would
one day perish. Certainly, so far, the tumultuous
decision of the Parliament on the shores of Lake
Pelso was a false step in the nation's history.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>


<h3>STORM AND STRESS.</h3>

<p>Death of Theudemir, and accession of Theodoric--Leo the Butcher--The
Emperor Zeno--The march of Theodoric against the son
of Trianus--His invasion of Macedonia--Defeat of his rear guard--His
compact with the Emperor.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/023.png">he imagination
of a boy is
healthy, and the mature imagination
of a man is healthy, but
there is a space of life between,
in which the soul is in a ferment,
the character undecided, the
way of life uncertain, the ambition
thick-sighted".--(KEATS,
Preface to "Endymion".)</p>

<p>The sentence thus written by the sensitive young
poet, a child of London of the nineteenth century,
was eminently exemplified in the history of the martial
chief of the Ostrogoths. The next fourteen
years in the life of Theodoric, which will be described
in this chapter, were years of much useless endeavour,
<a name="p63" id="p63"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 63</span>
of marches and countermarches, of alliances formed
and broken, of vain animosities and vainer reconciliations,
years in which Theodoric himself seems never
to understand his own purpose, whether it shall be
under the shadow of the Empire or upon the ruins
of the Empire, that he will build up his throne.
Take the map of what is now often called "the
Balkan peninsula", the region in which these fourteen
years were passed; look at the apparently purpose,
less way in which the mountain ranges of Hæmus,
Rhodope, and Scardus cross, intersect, run parallel,
approach, avoid one another; look at the strange entanglement
of passes and watersheds and table-lands
which their systems display to us. Even such
as the ranges among which he was manœuvring--perplexed,
purposeless, and sterile--was the early
manhood of Theodoric.</p>

<p>About 474, soon after the great Southward migration,
Theudemir died at Cyrrhus in Macedonia, one
of the new settlements of the Ostrogoths. When he
was attacked by his fatal sickness he called his people
together and pointed to Theodoric as the heir of
his royal dignity. Kingship at this time among the
Germanic nations was not purely hereditary, the consent
of the people being required even in the most
ordinary and natural cases of succession, such as
that of a first-born son, full grown and a tried soldier
succeeding to an aged father. In such cases, however,
that consent was almost invariably given. Theodoric,
at any rate, succeeded without disputes to
the doubtful and precarious position of king of the
Ostrogoths.</p>
<a name="p64" id="p64"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 64</span>
<p>Almost at the same time a change was being made
by death in the wearer of the Imperial diadem. In
order to illustrate the widely different character of
the Roman and the Gothic monarchies it will be
well to cease for a little time to follow the fortunes
of Theodoric and to sketch the history of Leo, the
dying Emperor, and of Zeno, who succeeded him.</p>

<p>Leo I., who reigned at Constantinople from 457 to
474, and who was therefore Emperor during the
whole time that Theodoric dwelt there as hostage,
was not, as far as we can ascertain, a man of any
great abilities in peace or war, or originally of very
exalted station. But he was "curator" or steward
in the household of Aspar, the successful barbarian
adventurer who has been already alluded to.<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a>
<a href="#footnote34"><sup class="sml">34</sup></a> As
an Arian by religion, and a barbarian, or the son of
a barbarian, by birth, Aspar could not himself assume
the diadem, but he could give it to whom he would,
and Leo the steward was the second of his dependants
whom he had thus honoured. Once placed
upon the throne, however, Leo showed himself less
obsequious to his old master than was expected.
The post of Prefect of the City became vacant;
Aspar suggested for the office a man who, like himself,
was tainted with the heresy of Arius. At the
moment Leo promised acquiescence, but immediately
repented, and in the dead of night privately
conferred the important office on a Senator who professed
the orthodox faith. Aspar in a rage laid a
rough hand on the Imperial purple, saying to Leo:
"Emperor! it is not fitting that one who wears this
<a name="p65" id="p65"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 65</span>
robe should tell lies". Leo answered with some
spirit: "Neither is it fitting that an Emperor should
be bound to do the bidding of any of his subjects,
and so injure the State".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote34"
name="footnote34"></a><b>Footnote 34:</b><a href="#footnotetag34">
(return) </a> See <a href="#p36">p. 36</a>.</blockquote>

<p>After this encounter there were thirteen years of
feud between King-maker and King, between Aspar
and Leo. At length in 471 Aspar and his three
valiant sons fell by the swords of the Eunuchs of
the Palace. The foul and cowardly deed was perhaps
marked by some circumstances of especial
cruelty, which earned for Leo the title by which he
was long after remembered in Constantinople, "The
Butcher".<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a>
<a href="#footnote35"><sup class="sml">35</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote35"
name="footnote35"></a><b>Footnote 35:</b><a href="#footnotetag35">
(return) </a> Leo Macellus.</blockquote>

<p>In order to strengthen himself against the adherents
of Aspar, Leo cultivated the friendship of a set
of wild, uncouth mountaineers, who at this time
played the same part in Constantinople which the
Swiss of the Middle Ages played in Italy. These
were the Isaurians, men from the rugged highlands
of Pisidia, whose lives had hitherto been chiefly spent
either in robbing or in defending themselves from
robbery. At their head was a man named Tarasicodissa,--probably
well born, if a chieftain from the
Isaurian highlands could be deemed to be well born
by the contemptuous citizens of Constantinople,
no soldier, for we are told that even the picture
of a battle frightened him, but a man whom the
other Isaurians seem to have followed with clannish
loyalty, like that which the Scottish Camerons
showed even to the wily and unwarlike Master of
Lovat.</p>
<a name="p66" id="p66"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 66</span>

<p>With Tarasicodissa therefore the Emperor Leo
entered into a compact of mutual defence. The
Isaurian dropped his uncouth name and assumed
the classical and philosophical-sounding name of
Zeno; he received the hand of Ariadne, daughter of
the Emperor, in marriage, and as Leo had no male
offspring, the little Leo, offspring of this marriage
and therefore grandson of the aged Emperor, was, in
this monarchy which from elective was ever becoming
more strictly hereditary, generally accepted as
his probable successor.</p>

<p>As it had been planned so it came to pass. Leo
the Butcher died (3d Feb. 474); the younger Leo,
a child of seven years old, was hailed by Senate and
People as his successor: Zeno came at the head of
a brilliant train of senators, soldiers, and magistrates,
to "adore" the new Emperor, and the child, carefully
instructed by his mother in the part which he
had to play, placed on the bowed head of his father
the Imperial diadem. This act of "association" as
it was called, generally practised upon a son or
nephew by a veteran Emperor anxious to be relieved
from some of the cares of reigning, required to be
ratified by the acclamations of the soldiery; but no
doubt these acclamations, which could generally be
purchased by a sufficiently liberal donative, were not
wanting on this occasion. Zeno, otherwise called Tarasicodissa
the Isaurian, was now Emperor, and nine
months after, when his child-partner died, he became
sole ruler of the Roman world, except in so far as
his dignity might be considered to be shared by the
phantom Emperors of the West, who at this time
<a name="p67" id="p67"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 67</span>
were dethroning and being dethroned with fatal
rapidity at Rome and Ravenna.</p>

<p>Thus mean and devious were the paths by which
an adventurer could climb in the fifth century to
that which was still looked upon as the pinnacle of
earthly greatness. For however unworthy a man
might feel himself to be, and however unworthy all
his subjects might know him to be of the highest
place in the Empire, when once he had obtained it
his power was absolute and the honours rendered
to him were little less than divine. All laws were
passed by his "sacred providence"; all officers, military
and civil, received their authority from him.
In the edicts which he put forth to the world he
spoke of himself as "My Eternity", "My Mildness",
"My Magnificence", and of course these expressions,
or, if it were possible, expressions more adulatory
than these, were used by his subjects when they laid
their petitions at the footstool of "the sacred throne".
He lived, withdrawn from vulgar eyes, in the innermost
recesses of the palace, a sort of Holy of Holies behind
the first and the second veil. A band of pages, in
splendid dress, waited upon his bidding; thirty stately
<i>silentiarii</i>, with helmets and brightly burnished cuirasses,
marched backwards and forwards before the
second veil, to see that no importunate petitioner
disturbed the silence of "the sacred cubicle". On
the comparatively rare occasions when he showed
himself to his subjects, he wore upon his head the
diadem, a band of white linen, in which blazed the
most precious jewels of the Empire. Hung round
his shoulders and reaching down to his feet was that
<a name="p68" id="p68"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 68</span>
precious purple robe, for the sake of which so many
crimes were committed, and which often proved itself
a very "garment of Nessus" to him who dared to
assume it without force sufficient to render his usurpation
legitimate. On the feet of the Emperor were
buskins which, like the diadem, were studded with
precious stones, and like the robe were dyed with the
Imperial purple. Thus gorgeously arrayed he took
his place in the <i>podium,</i> the royal box in the Amphitheatre,
and from thence, while gazed upon by his
subjects, gazed himself upon the savage beast-fight,
or in the Hippodrome, with difficulty restraining his
eagerness for the success of the Blue or the Green
faction, gave the sign for the chariot races to begin.
Or he sat surrounded by his court in the purple
presence-chamber to consult upon public affairs with
his Consistory, a sort of Privy Council, composed of
the great ministers of state. Conspicuous among
these were the fifteen officers of highest rank, Generals,
Judges, Grand Chamberlains, Finance Ministers,
who had each the right to be addressed as "Illustrious".
When any subject of the Emperor, were it
one of these Illustrious ones himself, were it the son
or brother of his predecessor, were it even a former
patron, like Aspar, by whose favour he had been
selected to wear the purple, was admitted to an
audience of "Augustus" (that great name went as
of right with the diadem), the etiquette of the court
required that he should not merely bow nor kneel,
but absolutely prostrate himself before the Sacred
Majesty of the Emperor, who, if in a gracious mood,
then with outstretched hand raised him from the
<a name="p69" id="p69"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 69</span>
earth and permitted him to kiss his knee or the
fringe of his Imperial mantle.</p>

<p>To this dizzy height of greatness--for such, however
small Marcian or Leo or Zeno may now seem
to us by the lapse of centuries, it was felt to be by
the contemporary generations--it was possible under
the singular combination of election and inheritance
which regulated the succession to the throne, for
almost any citizen of the Empire, if not of barbarian
blood or heretical creed, to aspire. Diocletian, the
second founder of the Empire, was the son of a
slave; Justinian--an even greater name--was the
nephew of a Macedonian peasant, who with a sheepskin
bag containing a week's store of biscuit, his only
property, tramped down from his native highlands
to seek his fortune in the capital Zeno, as we have
seen, though perhaps better born than either Diocletian
or Justinian, was only a little Isaurian chieftain.
Thus the possibilities open to aspiring ambition were
great in the Empire of the Cæsars. As any male
citizen of the United States, born between the St.
Lawrence and the Rio Grande, may one day be installed
in the White House as President, so any
"Roman" and orthodox inhabitant of the Empire,
whether noble, citizen, or peasant, might flatter himself
with the hope that he too should one day wear
the purple of Diocletian, be saluted as Augustus,
and see Prefects and Masters of the Soldiery prostrating
themselves before "His Eternity". This
was, in a sense, the better, the democratic side of the
Roman monarchy. Power which was supposed to
be conveyed by the will of the people (as expressed
<a name="p70" id="p70"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 70</span>
by the acclamations of the army) might be wielded
by the arm of any member of that people. On the
other hand there was an evil in the habit thus engendered
in men's minds, of humbling themselves
before mere power without regard to the manner of
its acquirement. When we compare the polity of
Rome or Constantinople, where a century was a long
time for the duration of a dynasty, with the far
simpler polities of the Teutonic tribes which invaded
the Empire, almost all of whom had their royal
houses, reaching back into and even beyond the
dawn of national history, supposed to be sprung
from the loins of the gods, and rendered illustrious
by countless deeds of valour recorded in song or
saga, we see at once that in these ruder states we
are in presence of a principle which the Empire
knew not, but which Mediæval Europe knew and
glorified, the principle of <i>Loyalty.</i> This principle,
the same that bound Bayard to the Valois, and
Montrose to the Stuart, has been, with all the follies
and even crimes which it may have caused, an element
of strength and cohesion in the states which
have arisen on the ruins of the Roman Empire. The
self-respecting but loving loyalty, with which the
Englishman of to-day cherishes the name of the descendant
of Cerdic, of Alfred, and of Edward Plantagenet,
who wields the sceptre of his country, is
utterly unlike the slavish homage offered by the
adoring courtiers of Byzantium to the pinchbeck
divinity of Zeno Tarasicodissa.</p>

<p>Raised as Zeno had been to the throne by a mere
palace intrigue, and destitute as he was of any of the
qualities of a great statesman or general, it is no
<a name="p71" id="p71"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 71</span>
wonder that his reign, which lasted for seventeen
years, was continually disturbed by conspiracies and
rebellions. In most of these rebellions his mother-in-law,
Verina, widow of Leo, an ambitious and turbulent
woman, played an important part.</p>

<p>It was only a year after Zeno's accession to sole
power by the death of his son (Nov., 475)
when he was surprised by the outbreak of a conspiracy,
hatched by his mother-in-law, the object of
which was to place her brother Basiliscus on the
throne. Zeno fled by night, still wearing the Imperial
robes which he had worn, sitting in the Hippodrome,
when the tidings reached him, and crossing the Bosphorus
was soon in the heart of Asia Minor, safe
sheltered in his native Isauria.</p>

<p>From thence,(July, 477) after nearly two years of exile,
he was by a strange turn of the wheel of Fortune
restored to his throne. Religious bigotry (for Basiliscus
did not belong to the party of strict orthodoxy)
and domestic jealousies and perfidies all contributed
to this result. Zeno, who had fled twenty months
before from the Hippodrome, returned to the Amphitheatre,
and there, having commanded that the
linen curtain should be drawn over the circus to exclude
the too piercing rays of the July sun, gave the
signal for the games to begin, while the populace
shouted in Latin the regular official congratulations on
his elevation and prayers for his continued triumph.<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a>
<a href="#footnote36"><sup class="sml">36</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote36"
name="footnote36"></a><b>Footnote 36:</b><a href="#footnotetag36">
(return) </a>
"Zeno Imperator Tu Vincas", would be, as we know from
other similar instances, the most frequently uttered acclamation.
It is a curious instance of "survival" that this was always shouted in Latin, though Greek was the vernacular tongue of the vast majority of the inhabitants of Constantinople.</blockquote>

<a name="p72" id="p72"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 72</span>

<p>Meanwhile his fallen rival, less fortunate than
Zeno himself in planning an escape, was crouching
in the baptistery of the great Church of Saint
Sophia, whither with his wife and children he had
fled for refuge. After all the emblems of Imperial
dignity had been rudely stripped from them, Basiliscus
was induced, by a promise from Zeno, "that
their heads should be safe", to come forth with his
family from the sacred asylum. The Emperor
"kept the word of promise to the ear", since no
executioner with drawn sword entered the chamber
of his rival. Basiliscus and they that were with him
were sent away to a remote fortress in Cappadocia.
The gate of the fortress was built up, a band of wild
Isaurians guarded the enclosure, suffering no man to
enter or to leave it, and in that bleak stronghold before
long the fallen Emperor and Empress with their
children perished miserably of cold and hunger.</p>

<p>Theodoric, who was at this time settled with his
people, not on the shores of the Ægean, but in the
region which we now call the Dobrudscha, between
the mouths of the Danube and the Black Sea, had
zealously espoused the cause of the banished Zeno,
and lent an effectual hand in the counter-revolution
which restored him to the throne (478). For his
services in this crisis he was rewarded with the
dignities of Patrician and Master of the Soldiery, high
honours for a barbarian of twenty-four; and probably
about this time he was also adopted as "<i>filius in
arma</i>" by the Emperor. What the precise nature of
this adopted "sonship-in-arms" may have been we
are not able to say. It reminds us of the barbarian customs
<a name="p73" id="p73"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 73</span>
which in the course of centuries ripened into
the mediæval ceremony of knighthood, and the whole
transaction certainly sounds more Ostrogothic than
Imperial. Zeno's own son and namesake (the offspring
of a first marriage before his union with Ariadne)
was apparently dead before this time; and possibly
therefore the title of son thus conferred upon Theodoric
may have raised in his heart wild hopes that
he too might one day be saluted as Roman Emperor.
Any such hopes were probably doomed to inevitable
disappointment. Any other dignity in the State,
the "Roman Republic", as it still called itself, was
practically within reach of a powerful barbarian, but
the diadem, as has been already said, could in this
age of the world, only be worn by one of pure
Roman, that is, non-barbarian, blood.</p>

<p>At this time, and for the next three years, the
position of our Theodoric, both towards the Emperor
and towards his own people, was sorely embarrassed
by the position and the claims of the other,
the squinting Theodoric (son of Triarius), whom we
met with seventeen years ago, and whose receipt of
<i>stipendia</i> from the court of Constantinople, at the
very time when their own were withheld, raised the
wrath of Walamir and Theudemir. This Theodoric,
it will be remembered, was of unkingly, perhaps of
quite ignoble, birth, had risen to greatness by clinging
to the skirts of Aspar, and had, so far as the Emperor's
favour was concerned, fallen with his fall. Shortly
before the death of Leo he had appeared in arms
against the Empire, taking one city and besieging
another, and had forced the Emperor to concede to
<a name="p74" id="p74"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 74</span>
him high rank in the army (that of General of the
Household Troops,<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a>
<a href="#footnote37"><sup class="sml">37</sup></a>) a subsidy of; £80,000 a year for
himself and his people, and lastly a remarkable stipulation,
"that he should be absolute ruler<a id="footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a>
<a href="#footnote38"><sup class="sml">38</sup></a> of the
Goths, and that the Emperor should not receive any
of them who were minded to revolt from him". This
strange article of the treaty shows us, on the one
hand, how thoroughly fictitious and illegitimate
was <i>this</i> Theodoric's claim to kinship; since assuredly
neither Alaric, nor Ataulfus, nor Theudemir,
nor any of the genuine kings of the Goths, ever
needed to bolster up their authority over their subjects
by any such figment of an Imperial concession;
and on the other hand, as it coincides in date
with the time of Theudemir's and <i>his</i> Theodoric's
entrance into the Empire, it shows us the distracting
influences to which the large number of Gothic settlers
south of the Danube, settled there before
Theudemir's migration, were exposed by that event.
There can be little doubt that the Goths who were
minded to revolt from the son of Triarius and who
were not to be received into favour by the Emperor,
were Ostrogoths, still dimly conscious of the old tie
which bound them to the glorious house of Amala,
and more than half disposed to forsake the service
of their squinting upstart chief in order to follow the
banners of the young hero, son of Theudemir.</p>

<p>Then came the death of Leo (478), Zeno's accession and
the insurrection of Basiliscus, in which the son of Triarius
took part against the Isaurian Emperor.
Soon after this insurrection was ended and
<a name="p75" id="p75"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 75</span>
Zeno was restored to his precarious throne, there
came an embassy from the <i>fœderati</i> (as they called
themselves) that is, from the unattached Goths who
followed the Triarian standard, begging Zeno to be
reconciled to their lord, and hinting that he was a
truer friend to the Empire than the petted and pampered
son of Theudemir. After a consultation
with "the Senate and People of Rome", in other
words, with the nobles of Constantinople and the
troops of the household, Zeno decided that to take
<i>both</i> the Theodorics into his pay would be too heavy
a charge on the treasury; that there was no reason
for breaking with the young Amal, his ally, and
therefore that the request of his rival must be refused.
Open war followed, consisting chiefly of
devastating raids by the son of Triarius into the valleys
of Mœsia and Thrace. A message was sent to
Theodoric the Amal, who was dwelling quietly with
his people by the Danube. "Why are you lingering in
your home? Come forth and do great deeds worthy
of a Master of Roman Soldiery". "But if I take
the field against the son of Triarius", was the answer,
"I fear that you will make peace with him
behind my back". The Emperor and Senate bound
themselves by solemn oaths that he should never be
received back into favour, and an elaborate plan of
campaign was arranged, according to which the
Amal marching with his host from Marcianople,
(<i>Shumla</i>) was to be met by one general with twelve
thousand troops, on the southern side of the Balkans,
and by another with thirty thousand in the valley
of the Hebrus (<i>Maritza</i>).</p>

<a name="p76" id="p76"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 76</span>

<p>But the Roman Empire, in its feeble and flaccid
old age, seemed to have lost all capacity for
making war. Theodoric the Amal performed his
share of the compact; but when with his weary
army, encumbered with many women and children,
he emerged from the passes of the Balkans he
found no Imperial generals there to meet him, but,
instead, Theodoric the Squinter with a large army
of Goths encamped on an inaccessible hill. Neither
chief gave the signal for combat; perhaps both
were restrained by a reluctance to urge the fratricidal
strife; but there were daily skirmishes between
the light-armed horsemen at the foraging grounds
and places for watering. Every day, too, the son of
Triarius rode round the hostile camp, shouting forth
reproaches against his rival, calling him "a perjured
boy, a madman, a traitor to his race, a fool who
could not see whither the Imperial plans were tending.
The Romans would stand by and look quietly
on while Goth wore out Goth in deadly strife".
Murmurs from the Amal's troops showed that these
words struck home. Next day the son of Triarius
climbed a hill overlooking the camp, and again
raised his voice in bitter defiance. "Scoundrel!
why are you leading so many of my kinsmen to destruction?
why have you made so many Gothic
wives widows? What has become of that wealth
and plenty which they had when they first took
service with you? Then they had two or three
horses apiece; now without horses and in the guise
of slaves, they are wandering on foot through Thrace.
But they are free-born men surely, aye, as free-born
<a name="p77" id="p77"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 77</span>
as you are, and they once measured out the gold
coins of Byzantium with a bushel". When the host
heard these words, all, both men and women, went
to their leader Theodoric the Amal, and claimed
from him with tumultuous cries that he should come
to an accommodation with the son of Tnarius. The
proposal must have been hateful to the Amal. To
throw away the laboriously earned favour of the
Emperor, to denude himself of the splendid dignity
of Master of the Soldiery, to leave the comfortable
home-like fabric of Imperial civilisation and go out
again into the barbarian wilderness with this insolent
namesake who had just been denouncing him as a
perjured boy: all this was gall and wormwood to
the spirit of Theodoric. But he knew the conditions
under which he held his sovereignty--"king", as a
recent French monarch expressed it, "by the grace of
God and the will of the people", and he did not
attempt to strive against the decision of his tumultuary
parliament. He met his elderly competitor,
each standing on the opposite bank of a disparting
stream, and after speech had, they agreed that
they would wage no more war on one another but
would make common cause against Byzantium.</p>

<p>The now confederated Theodorics sent an embassy
to Zeno, bearing their common demands for territory,
<i>stipendia</i> and rations for their followers, and, in the
case of Theodoric the Amal, charged with bitter complaints
of the desertion which had exposed him to
such dangers. The Emperor replied with an accusation
(which appears to have been wholly unfounded)
that Theodoric himself had meditated treachery,
<a name="p78" id="p78"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 78</span>
and that this was the reason why the Roman generals
had feared to join their forces to his. Still
the Emperor was willing to receive him again into
favour if he would relinquish his alliance with the
son of Triarius, and in order to lure him back
the ambassadors were to offer him 1,000 pounds'
weight of gold (£40,000), 10,000 of silver (£35,000), a
yearly revenue of 10,000 <i>aurei</i> (£6,000), and the
daughter of Olybrius, one of the noblest-born damsels
of Byzantium, for his wife. But the Amal king,
having stooped so low as to make an alliance with
the son of Triarius, was not going to stoop lower by
breaking it. The ambassadors returned to Constantinople
with their purpose unaccomplished, and
Zeno began seriously to prepare for the apparently
inevitable war with all the Gothic <i>fœderati</i> in his
land, commanded by both the Theodorics. He summoned
to the capital all the troops whom he could
muster, and delivered to them a spirited oration, in
which he exhorted them to be of good courage,
declaring that he himself would go forth with them
to war, and would share all their hardships and dangers.
For nearly a hundred years, ever since the
time of the great Theodosius, no Eastern Emperor
apparently had conducted a campaign in person;
and the announcement that this inactivity was to
be ended and that a Roman Imperator was again,
like the Imperators of old time, to march with the
legions and to withstand the shock of battle, roused
the soldiers to extraordinary enthusiasm. The very
men who, a little while before, had been bribing the
officers to procure exemption from service, now
<a name="p79" id="p79"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 79</span>
offered larger sums of money in order to obtain
an opportunity of distinguishing themselves under
the eyes of the Emperor. They pressed forward
past the long wall which at about sixty miles from
Constantinople crossed the narrow peninsula and
defended the capital of the Empire; they caught
some of the forerunners of the Gothic host, the
Uhlans, if we may call them so, of Theodoric:
everything foreboded an encounter, more serious
and perhaps more triumphant than any that had
been seen since the days of Theodosius. Then, as in
a moment, all was changed. Zeno's old spirit of sloth
and cowardice returned. He would not undergo
the fatigue of the long marches through Thrace, he
would not look upon the battle-field, the very pictures
of which he found so terrible; it was publicly
announced that the Emperor would not go forth to
war. The soldiers, enraged, began to gather in
angry groups, rebuking one another for their over-patience
in submitting to be ruled by such a coward.
"How? Are we men, and have we swords in
our hands, and shall we any longer bear with such
disgraceful effeminacy, by which the might of this
great Empire is sapped, so that every barbarian who
chooses may carve out a slice from it?"</p>

<p>These clamours were rapidly growing seditious,
and in a few days an anti-Emperor would probably
have been proclaimed; but Zeno, more afraid of
his soldiers than even of the Goths, adroitly moved
them into their widely-scattered winter-quarters,
leaving the invaded provinces to take care of themselves
for a little time, while he tried by his own
<a name="p80" id="p80"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 80</span>
natural weapons of bribery and intrigue to detach
the <i>other</i> and older Theodoric from the new confederacy.</p>

<p>On this path he met with unmerited success.
The son of Triarius, who had lately been uttering
such noble sentiments about Gothic kinship, and
the folly of Gothic warriors playing into the hands
of their hereditary enemies, the crafty courtiers of
Constantinople, soon came to terms with the Emperor,
and on receiving the command of two brigades
of household troops,(Scholse) his restoration to all the
dignities which he had held under Basiliscus, the military
office which his rival had forfeited, and rations
and allowances for 13,000 of his followers, broke
his alliance with Theodoric the Amal, and entered
the service of the Emperor of New Rome.</p>

<p>Theodoric the Amal, who was now in his own despite (479)
an outlaw from the Roman State, burst
in fierce wrath into Macedonia, into the region
where he and his people had been first quartered five
years before. Again he marched down the valley
of the Vardar, he took Stobi, putting its garrison to
the sword, and threatened the great city of Thessalonica.
The citizens, fearing that Zeno would abandon
them to the barbarians, broke out into open
sedition, threw down the statues of the Emperor,
took the keys of the city from the Prefect and entrusted
them to the safer keeping of their Bishop.
Zeno sent ambassadors reproaching the Amal for his
ungrateful requital of the unexampled favours and
dignities which had been conferred upon him, and
<a name="p81" id="p81"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 81</span>
inviting him to return to his old fidelity. Theodoric
showed himself not unwilling to treat, sent ambassadors
to Constantinople, and ordered his troops to
refrain from murder and conflagration, and to take
only the absolute necessaries of life from the provincials.
He then quitted the precincts of Thessalonica
and moved westwards to the city of Heraclea <i>(Monastir)</i>,
which lies at the foot of the great mountain
range that separates Macedonia from Epirus. While
talking of peace he was already meditating a new
and brilliant stroke of strategy, but he was for some
time hindered from accomplishing it by the illness
of his sister, who, perhaps fatigued by the hardships
of the march, had fallen sick in the camp before
Heraclea. This time of enforced delay was occupied
by negotiations with the Emperor. But the
Emperor had really nothing to offer worth the Ostrogoth's
acceptance. A settlement on the Pantalian
plain, a bleak upland among the Balkans, about forty
miles south of Sardica <i>(Sofia)</i>, and a payment of
two hundred pounds' weight of gold (Â£8,000) as
subsistence-money for the people till they should
have had time to till the land and reap their first
harvest, this was all that Zeno offered to the chief,
who already in imagination saw the rich cities of
the Adriatic lying defenceless at his feet. For
during this time of inaction the Amal had opened
communications with a Gothic landowner, named
Sigismund, who dwelt near Dyrrhachium <i>(Durazzo)</i>,
and was a man of influence in the province of Epirus; and Sigismund, though nominally a loyal subject
of the Emperor, was doing his best to sow fear
<a name="p82" id="p82"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 82</span>
and discouragement in the hearts of the citizens of
Dyrrhachium and to prepare the way for the advent
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>At length the Gothic princess died, and her brother,
the Amal, having vainly sought to put Heraclea to
ransom (the citizens had retired to a strong fortress
which commanded it), burned the deserted city, a
deed more worthy of a barbarian than of one bred
up in the Roman Commonwealth. Then with all
his nation-army he started off upon the great Egnatian
Way, which, threading the rough passes of Mount
Scardus, leads from Macedonia to Epirus, from the
shores of the Ægean to the shores of the Adriatic.
His light horsemen went first to reconnoitre the
path; then followed Theodoric himself with the
first division of his army. Soas, his second in command,
ordered the movements of the middle host;
last of all came the rear-guard, commanded by Theodoric's
brother, Theudimund, and protecting the
march of the women, the cattle, and the waggons.
It was a striking proof both of their leader's audacity
and of his knowledge of the decay of martial
spirit among the various garrisons that lined the
Egnatian Way, that he should have ventured with
such a train into such a perilous country, where at
every turn were narrow defiles which a few brave
men might have held against an army.</p>

<p>The Amal and his host passed safely through the
defiles of Scardus and reached the fortress of Lychnidus
overlooking a lake now known as Lake Ochrida.
Here Theodoric met with his first repulse.
The fortress was immensely strong by nature, was
<a name="p83" id="p83"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 83</span>
well stored with corn, and had springing fountains
of its own, and the garrison were therefore not to be
frightened into surrender. Accordingly, leaving the
fortress untaken, Theodoric with his two first divisions
pushed rapidly across the second and lower
range, the Candavian Mountains, leaving Theudimund
with the waggons and the women to follow
more slowly. In this arrangement there was probably
an error of judgment which Theodoric had
occasion bitterly to regret. For the moment, however,
he was completely successful. Descending
into the plain he took the towns of Scampæ (<i>Elbassan</i>)
and Dyrrhachium (<i>Durazzo</i>), both of which,
probably owing to the discouraging counsels of
Sigismund, seem to have been abandoned by their
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Great was the consternation at Edessa (a town
about thirty miles west of Thessalonica and the
headquarters of the Imperial troops) when the news
of this unexpected march of Theodoric across the
mountains was brought into the camp. Not only
the general-in-chief, Sabinianus, was quartered there,
but also a certain Adamantius, an official of the highest
rank, who had been charged by Zeno with the
conduct of the negotiations with Theodoric, and
whose whole soul seems to have been set on the
success of his mission. He contrived to communicate
with Theodoric, and advanced with Sabinianus
through the mountains as far as Lychnidus in order
to conduct the discussion at closer quarters. Propositions
passed backwards and forwards as to the
terms upon which a meeting could be arranged.
<a name="p84" id="p84"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 84</span>
Theodoric sent a Gothic priest; Adamantius in reply
offered to come in person to Dyrrhachium if Soas
and another Gothic noble were sent as hostages for
his safe return. Theodoric was willing to send the
hostages if Sabinianus would swear that they should
return in safety. This, however, for some reason or
other, the general surlily and stubbornly refused to
do, and Adamantius saw the earnestly desired interview
fading away into impossibility. At length,
with courageous self-devotion, he succeeded in finding
a by-path across the mountains, which brought
him to a fort, situated on a hill and strengthened by
a deep ditch, in sight of Dyrrhachium. From thence
he sent messengers to Theodoric earnestly soliciting
a conference; and the Amal, leaving his army in the
plain, rode with a few horsemen to the banks of the
stream which separated him from Adamantius'
stronghold. Adamantius, too, to guard against a surprise,
placed his little band of soldiers in a circle
round the hill, and then descended to the stream,
and with none to listen to their speech, commenced
the long-desired colloquy. How Adamantius may
have opened his case we are not informed, but the
Ostrogoth's reply is worth quoting word for word:
"It was my choice to live altogether out of Thrace,
far away towards Scythia, where I should disturb no
one by my presence, and yet should be ready to go
forth thence to do the Emperor's bidding. But you
having called me forth, as if for war against the son
of Tnarius, first of all promised that the General of
Thrace should immediately join me with his forces
(he never appeared); and then that Claudius, the
<a name="p85" id="p85"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 85</span>
Steward of the Goth-money,<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a>
<a href="#footnote39"><sup class="sml">39</sup></a> should meet me with
the pay of the mercenaries (him I never saw); and
thirdly, you gave me guides for my journey, but what
sort of guides? Men who, leaving untrodden all the
easier roads into the enemy's country, led me by a steep
path and along the sharp edges of cliffs, where, had
the enemy attacked us, travelling as we were bound
to do with horsemen and waggons and all the lumber
of our camp, it had been a marvel if I and all my
folk had not been utterly destroyed. Hence I was
forced to make such terms as I could with the foes,
and in fact I owe them many thanks that, when you
had betrayed and they might have consumed me,
they nevertheless spared my life".</p>

<p>Adamantius went over the old story about the
great benefits which the Emperor had bestowed on
Theodoric, the Patriciate, the Mastership, the rich
presents, and all the other evidences of his fatherly
regard. He attempted to answer the charges brought
by Theodoric, but in this even the Greek historian<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a>
<a href="#footnote40"><sup class="sml">40</sup></a>
who records the dialogue thinks that he failed.
With more show of reason he complained of the march
across the mountains and the dash into Epirus, while
negotiations were proceeding with Constantinople.
He recommended him to make peace with the Empire
while it was in his power, and assuring him that
he would never be allowed to lord it over the great
cities of Epirus nor to banish their citizens from
thence to make room for his people, again pressed
him to accept the Emperor's offer of "Dardania"
<a name="p86" id="p86"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 86</span>
(the Pantalian plain), "where there was abundance
of land, beside that which was already inhabited, a
fair and fertile territory lacking cultivators, which
his people could till, so providing themselves in
abundance with all the necessaries of life".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote40"
name="footnote40"></a><b>Footnote 40:</b><a href="#footnotetag40">
(return) </a> Malchus of Philadelphia.</blockquote>

<p>Theodoric refused with an oath to take his toil-worn
people who had served him so faithfully, at that
time of year (it was now perhaps autumn) into Dardania.
No! they must all remain in Epirus for the
winter; then if they could agree upon the rest of the
terms he might be willing in spring to follow a guide
sent by the Emperor to lead them to their new abode.
But more than this, he was ready to deposit his baggage
and all his unwarlike folk in any city which
the Emperor might appoint, to give his mother and
his sister as hostages for his entire fidelity, and then
to advance at once with ten thousand of his bravest
warriors into Thrace, as the Emperor's ally. With
these men and the Imperial armies now stationed in
the Illyrian provinces, he would undertake to sweep
Thrace clear of all the Goths who followed the son
of Triarius. Only he stipulated that in that case he
should be clothed with his old dignity of Master of
the Soldiery, which had been taken from him and
bestowed on his rival, and that he should be received
into the Commonwealth and allowed to live--as he
evidently yearned to live--as a Roman citizen.</p>

<p>Adamantius replied that he was not empowered
to treat on such terms while Theodoric remained in
Epirus, but he would refer his proposal to the Emperor,
and with this understanding they parted one
from the other.</p>

<a name="p87" id="p87"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 87</span>

<p>Meanwhile, important, and for the Goths disastrous,
events had been taking place in the Candavian
mountains. Over these the rear-guard of Theodoric's
army, with the waggons and the baggage, had been
slowly making its way, in a security which was no
doubt chiefly caused by the facility of the previous
marches, but to which the knowledge of the negotiations
going forward between King and Emperor may
partly have contributed. In any case, security was
certainly insecure with such a fort as Lychnidus untaken
in their rear. The garrison of that fort had
been reinforced by many cohorts of the regular
army who had flocked thither at the general's signal,
and with these Sabinianus prepared a formidable
ambuscade. He sent a considerable number of infantry
round by unfrequented paths over the mountains,
and ordered them to take up a commanding
but concealed position, and to rush forth from
thence at a given signal. He himself started with
his cavalry from Lychnidus at nightfall, and rode
rapidly along the Egnatian Way. At dawn the pursuing
horsemen attacked the Goths, who were just
descending the last mountain slopes into the plain.
Theudimund, with his mother, was riding near the
head of the long line of march. Too anxious
perhaps for her safety, and fearing to meet the reproachful
looks of Theodoric if aught of harm
happened to her, he hurried her across the last
bridge, spanning a deep defile, which intervened
between the mountains and the plain, and then
broke down the bridge behind him to prevent pursuit.
Pursuit was indeed rendered impossible, and
<a name="p88" id="p88"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 88</span>
the mother of Theodoric was saved, but at what a
cost! The Goths turned back to fight, with the
courage of despair, the pursuing cavalry. At that
moment the infantry in ambush, having received the
signal, began to attack them from the rocks above.
The position was a terrible one, and many brave
men fell in the hopeless battle. Quarter, however,
was given by the Imperial soldiers, for we are told
that more than five thousand of the Goths were taken
prisoners. The booty was large; and all the waggons
of the barbarians, two thousand in number, were of
course captured, but the soldiers, misliking the toil of
dragging them back over all those jagged passes to
Lychnidus, burned them there as they stood upon
the Candavian mountains.

<p>I have copied with some minuteness the account
given us by the Greek historian of this mountain
march of Theodoric, because it brings before us with
more than usual vividness the conditions under
which the campaigns of the barbarians were conducted.
It will have been noticed that the Gothic
army is not only an army but a nation, and that the
campaign is also a migration. The mother and the
sister of Theodoric are accompanying him. There
is evidently a long train of non-combatants, old men,
women, and children, following the army in those
two thousand Gothic waggons. The character attributed
by Horace to the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">Campestres Scythæ,</p>
<p>Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos</p>
</div></div>

<p>still survives.</p>

<a name="p89" id="p89"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 89</span>

<p>The Goth, a terrible enemy to those outside the pale
of his kinship, is a home-lover at heart, and even in
war will not separate himself from his wife and children.
This makes his impact slow, his campaigns
unscientific. It prepares for him frequent defeats,
such as that of the Candavian mountains, which a
celibate army would have avoided. But it makes
his conquests, when he does conquer, more enduring,
while it explains those perpetual demands for
land, for a settlement within the Empire, almost on
any terms, with which, as was before shown, the
barbarian inroads so often close. We need not follow
the tedious story of the negotiations with Adamantius,
which were interrupted by this sudden
success of the Imperial arms. In fact at this point
our best authority,<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a>
<a href="#footnote41"><sup class="sml">41</sup></a> who has been unusually full and
graphic for the events of 478 and 479, suddenly fails
us, and we have scarcely anything but dry and
scanty annalistic notices for the next nine years of
the life of Theodoric. He seems not to have maintained
his footing in Epirus, but to have returned to
the neighbourhood of the Danube, where he fought
and conquered the king of the Bulgarians, a fresh
horde of barbarians who at this time made their first
appearance in "the Balkan peninsula" Whether the
much desired reconciliation with the Empire took
place we know not. It seems probable that this may
have been the case, as in the year 481 we find his
rival, the other Theodoric, in opposition, and planning
<a name="p90" id="p90"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 90</span>
an invasion of Greece. But the career of the
son of Triarius was about to come to an untimely
close. Marching westwards, he had reached a station
on the Egnatian Way, near the frontiers of Thrace
and Macedonia, called "The Stables of Diomed",
and there pitched his camp. One morning he would
fain mount his horse for a gallop across the plain,
but before he was securely seated in the saddle the
horse reared. The rider, afraid to grasp the bridle
firmly lest he should pull the creature over upon
him, clung tightly to his seat, but could not guide
the horse, which, in its dancing and prancing, came
sidling past the door of the tent. There was hanging,
in barbarian fashion, a spear fastened by a
thong. The horse shied up against the spear, whose
point gored his master's side. He was not killed on
the spot, but died soon after of the wound. After
some domestic dissensions and bloodshed, the leadership
of his band passed to his son Recitach, apparently
a hot-tempered and tyrannical youth.</p>

Porphyrogemtus.</blockquote>

<p>Three years after his father's death (484), Recitach, now
an enemy of the Empire, was put to death
by Theodoric the Amal, acting under the orders of
Zeno. The band of Triarian Goths, thirty thousand
fighting men in number, was joined to the army of
Theodoric, an important addition to his power, but
also to his cares, to the ever-present difficulty of
finding food for his followers.</p>


<p>(481-487) Backwards and forwards between peace and
war with the Empire, Theodoric wavered
during the six years which followed his rival's
death. The settlement of his people at this time
<a name="p91" id="p91"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 91</span>
seems to have been on the southern shore of
the Danube, in part of the countries now known
as Servia and Wallachia, with Novæ <i>(Sistova)</i>
for his headquarters. One year (482) he is making
a raid into Macedonia and Thessaly and plundering
Larissa. The next (483) he is again clothed
with his old dignity of Master of the Soldiery
and keeps his Goths rigidly within their allotted
limits. The next (484) he is actually raised to the
Consulate, an office which, though devoid of power,
is still so radiant with the glory of the illustrious
men who have held it for near a thousand years, from
the days of Brutus and Collatinus, that Emperors
covet the possession of it and the mightiest barbarian
chiefs in their service long for no higher reward.</p>

<p>Two years after this (486) he is again in rebellion,
ravaging Thrace; the next year (487) he has broken
through the Long Walls and penetrates within fourteen
miles of Constantinople. In all this wearisome
period of Theodoric's life his action seems to be
merely destructive; there is nothing constructive,
no fruitful or fertilising thought to be found in it.
Had this been a fair sample of his life, there could
be no reason why he should not sink into the oblivion
which covers so many forgotten freebooters. But in
488 a change came over the spirit of his dream. A
plan was agreed upon between him and the Emperor
(by which of them it was first suggested we cannot
now say) for the employment of all this wasted
and destructive force in another field, where its
energies might accomplish some result beneficent
and enduring.</p>

<a name="p92" id="p92"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 92</span>

<p>That new field was Italy, and in order to understand
the conditions of the problem which there
awaited Theodoric, we must briefly recount the
chief events which had happened in that peninsula
since Attila departed from untaken Rome in compliance
with the petition of Pope Leo.</p>

<h3>ITALY UNDER ODOVACAR.</h3>

<p>Condition of Italy--End of the line of Theodosius--Ricimer the
Patrician--Struggles with the Vandals--Orestes the Patrician
makes his son Emperor, who is called Augustulus--The fall of
the Western Empire and elevation of Odovacar--Embassies to
Constantinople.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/026.png">n former chapters I have very briefly sketched
the fortunes of the Italian
peninsula during two great barbarian
invasions--that of Alaric (407-410)
and that of Attila (452).   The
monarch who ruled the Western
Empire at the date of the last invasion
was Valentinian III., grandson
of the great Theodosius.    He
dwelt sometimes at Rome, sometimes
at Ravenna, which latter city, protected by the
waves of the Adriatic and by the innumerable canals
and pools through which the waters of two rivers <a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a>
<a href="#footnote42"><sup class="sml">42</sup></a>
<a name="p94" id="p94"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 94</span>
flowed lazily to the sea, was all but impregnable by
the barbarians. A selfish and indolent voluptuary,
Valentinian III. made no valuable contribution to
the defence of the menaced Empire, some stones of
which were being shaken down every year by the
tremendous blows of the Teutonic invaders. Any
wisdom that might be shown in the councils of the
State was due to his mother, Galla Placidia, who, till
her death in 451, was the real ruler of the Empire.
Any strength and valour that was displayed in its
defence was due to the great minister and general,
Aëtius, a man who had himself, probably, many drops
of barbarian blood in his veins, though he has been
not unfitly styled "the last of the Romans". It was
Aëtius who, as we have seen, in concert with the
Visigothic king, fought the fight of civilisation
against Hunnish barbarism on the Catalaunian battle-plain.
It was to "Aëtius, thrice Consul", that "the
groans of the Britons" were addressed when "the
Barbarians drove them to the sea, and the sea drove
them back on the Barbarians".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote42"
name="footnote42"></a><b>Footnote 42:</b><a href="#footnotetag42">
(return) </a> The Ronco and the Montone.</blockquote>

<p>When Attila was dead, the weak and worthless
Emperor seems to have thought that he might
safely dispense with the services of this too powerful
subject. Inviting Aëtius to his palace, he debated
with him a scheme for the marriage of their children
(the son of the general was to wed the daughter of
the Emperor), and when the debate grew warm, with
calculated passion he snatched a sword from one of
his guardsmen, and with it pierced the body of
Aëtius. The bloody work was finished by the
courtiers standing by, and the most eminent of the
<a name="p95" id="p95"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 95</span>
friends and counsellors of the deceased statesman
were murdered at the same time.</p>

<p>The foul assassination of this great defender of the
Roman State was requited next year by two barbarians
of his train, men who no doubt cherished for
Aëtius the same feelings of personal loyalty which
bound the members of a Teutonic "Comitatus" to
their chief, and who deemed life a dishonour while
their leader's blood remained unavenged. On a day
in March, while Valentinian was watching intently
the games in the Campus Martius of Rome, these
two barbarians rushed upon him and stabbed him,
slaying at the same time the eunuch, who had been
his chief confederate in the murder of Aëtius.</p>

<p>With Valentinian III. the line of Theodosius,
which had swayed the Roman sceptre for eighty-six
years, came to an end. None of the men
who after him bore the great title of Augustus in
Rome (I am speaking, of course, of the fifth century
only) succeeded in founding a dynasty. Not only
was no one of them followed by a son: scarcely
one of them was suffered to end his own reign in
peace. Of the nine Emperors who wore the purple
in Italy after the death of Valentinian, only two
ended their reigns in the course of nature, four were
deposed, and three met their death by violence.
Only one reigned for more than five years; several
could only measure the duration of their royalty by
months. Even the short period (455-476) which
these nine reigns occupy is not entirely filled by
them, for there were frequent interregna, one lasting
for a year and eight months.    And the men
<a name="p96" id="p96"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 96</span>
were as feeble as their kingly life was short and
precarious. With the single exception of Majorian,
(457-461), a brave and strong man, and one who, if
fair play had been given him, would have assuredly
done something to stay the ruin of the Empire, all
of these nine men (with whose names there is no
need to burden the reader's memory) are fitly named
by a German historian "the Shadow Emperors".</p>

<p>During sixteen years of this time (456-472), supreme
power in the Empire was virtually wielded
by a nobleman of barbarian origin, but naturalised
in the Roman State, the proud and stern "Patrician"
Ricimer. This man, descended from the chiefs of
the Suevi,<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a>
<a href="#footnote43"><sup class="sml">43</sup></a> grandson of a Visigothic king, and
brother-in-law of a king of the Burgundians, was
doubtless able to bring much barbaric influence to
support the cause which, from whatever motives,
he had espoused,--the cause of the defence of that
which was left to Rome of her Empire in the West
of Europe.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote43"

was at this time settled in the west of Spain and in Portugal.</blockquote>

<p>Many Teutonic tribes had by this time settled
themselves in the Imperial lands. Spain was quite
lost to the Empire: some fragments of Gaul were
still bound to it by a most precarious tie; but the
loss which threatened the life of the State most
nearly was the loss of Africa. For this province, the
capital of which was the restored and Romanised
city of Carthage, had been for generations the chief
exporter of corn to feed the pauperised population
of Rome, and here now dwelt and ruled, and from
<a name="p97" id="p97"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 97</span>
hence (428-432) sallied forth to his piratical raids against Italy,
the deadliest enemy of the Roman name, the king
of the Vandals, Gaiseric.<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a>
<a href="#footnote44"><sup class="sml">44</sup></a> The Vandal conquest of
Africa was, at the time which we have now
reached, a somewhat old story, nearly a generation
having elapsed since it occurred,<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a>
<a href="#footnote45"><sup class="sml">45</sup></a>
but the Vandal sack of Rome, which came to pass
immediately after the death of Valentinian III.,
and which marked the beginning of the period of
the "Shadow Emperors" was still near and terrible
to the memories of men. No Roman but remembered
in bitterness of soul how in June, 455,
the long ships of the Vandals appeared at the
mouth of the Tiber, how Gaiseric and his men
landed, marched to the Eternal City, and entered
it unopposed, how they remained there for a
fortnight, not perhaps slaying or ravishing, but
with calm insolence plundering the city of all that
they cared to carry away, stripping off what they
supposed to be the golden roof of the Capitol, removing
the statues from their pedestals, transporting
everything that seemed beautiful or costly, and
stowing away all their spoils in the holds of those
insatiable vessels of theirs which lay at anchor at
Ostia.</p>

<p>The remembrance of this humiliating capture and
the fear that it might at any moment be repeated,
probably with circumstances of greater atrocity, were
<a name="p98" id="p98"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 98</span>
the dominant emotions in the hearts of the Roman
Senate and people during the twenty-one years
which we are now rapidly surveying. It was doubtless
these feelings which induced them to submit
more patiently than they would otherwise have
done to the scarcely veiled autocracy of an imperfectly
Romanised Teuton such as Ricimer. He
was a barbarian, it was true; probably he could
not even speak Latin grammatically; but he was
mighty with the barbarian kings, mighty with the
<i>fœderati</i> the rough soldiers gathered from every
German tribe on the other side of the Alps, who
now formed the bulk of the Imperial army; let him
be as arrogant as he would to the Senate, let him
set up and pull down one "Shadow Emperor" after
another, if only he would keep the streets of Rome
from being again profaned by the tread of the terrible
Vandal.</p>

<p>(456-468) To a certain extent the confidence reposed in
Ricimer was not misplaced. He inflicted a severe
defeat on the Vandals in a naval engagement
near the island of Corsica; he raised
to the throne the young and valiant Majorian,
who repelled a Vandal invasion
of Campania; he planned, in conjunction with
the Eastern Emperor, a great expedition against
Carthage, which failed through no fault of his, but by
the bad generalship of Basiliscus, whose brother-in-law,
Leo, had appointed him to the command. But
the rule of a barbarian like Ricimer exercised on the
sacred soil of Italy, and the brutal arrogance with
which he dashed down one of his puppet-Emperors
<a name="p99" id="p99"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 99</span>
after another when they had served his purpose,
must have done much to break the spirit of the
Roman nobles and the Roman commonalty, and to
prepare the way for the Teutonic revolution which
occurred soon after his death. Above all, we have
reason to think that, during the whole time of
Ricimer's ascendancy, the barbarian <i>fœderati</i> were
becoming more absolutely dominant in the Roman
army, and with waxing numbers were growing more
insolent in their demeanour, and more intolerable In
their demands.</p>

<p>The ranks of the <i>fœderati</i> were at this time
recruited, not from one of the great historic
nationalities--Visigoth, Ostrogoth, Frank, or Burgundian,--but
chiefly from a number of petty tribes,
known as the Rugii, Scyri, Heruli, and Turcilingi,
who have failed to make any enduring mark in
history. These tribes, which upon the break-up
of Attila's Empire had established themselves on
the shore of the Middle Danube, north and west
of the lands occupied by the Ostrogoths, were continually
sending their young warriors over the passes
of Noricum (<i>Salzburg, Styria</i>, and <i>Carinthia</i>) to seek
their fortune in Italy. One of these recruits, on his
southward journey, stepped into the cave of a holy
hermit named Severinus, and stooping his lofty
stature in the lowly cell, asked the saint's blessing.
When the blessing was given, the youth said:
"Farewell". "Not farewell, but fare forward",<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a>
<a href="#footnote46"><sup class="sml">46</sup></a>
answered Severinus. "Onward into Italy: skin-clothed
now, but destined before long to enrich
<a name="p100" id="p100"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 100</span>
many men with costly gifts". The name of this
young recruit was Odovacar.<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a>
<a href="#footnote47"><sup class="sml">47</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote46"

name="footnote47"></a><b>Footnote 47:</b><a href="#footnotetag47">
(return) </a>
This is the form of the name used by contemporary historians;
Odoacer is a later and less authentic form.</blockquote>

<p>Odovacar probably entered Italy about 465. He
attached himself to the party of Ricimer, and before
long became a conspicuous captain of <i>fœderati</i>
After the death of Ricimer (18th August, 472), there
was a series of rapid revolutions in the Roman
State. Olybrius, the then reigning nonentity, died
in October of the same year.</p>

<p>(June, 474) After five months' interregnum, a yet more shadowy shadow, Glycerius,
succeeded him, and after fifteen
months of rule was thrust from the
throne by Julius Nepos, who had married the niece
of Verina, the mischief-making Augusta of the East,
and who was, therefore, supported by all the moral
influence of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Nepos, after fourteen months of Empire, in which
he distinguished himself only by the loss of some
(Oct.,475) Gaulish provinces to the Visigoths, was
in his turn dethroned by the Master of
the Soldiery, Orestes, who had once held a subordinate
situation in the court of Attila. Nepos fled to
Dalmatia, which was probably his native land, and
lived there for four years after his dethronement,
still keeping up some at least of the state which
belonged to a Roman Emperor.</p>

<p>We know very little of the pretexts for these
rapid revolutions, or the circumstances attending
them, but there cannot be much doubt that the
army was the chief agent in what, to borrow a phrase
<a name="p101" id="p101"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 101</span>
from modern Spanish politics, were a series of <i>pronunciamentos</i>.
For some reason which is dim to us,
Orestes, though a full-blooded Roman citizen, did
not set the diadem on his own head, but placed it on
that of his son, a handsome boy of some fourteen or
fifteen years, named Romulus, and nicknamed "the
little Augustus". For himself, he took the dignity
of "Patrician", which had been so long worn by
Ricimer, and was associated in men's minds with the
practical mastery of the Empire. But a ruler who
has been raised to the throne by military sedition
soon finds that the authors of his elevation are the
most exacting of masters. The <i>fœderati,</i> who knew
themselves now absolute arbiters of the destiny of the
Empire, and who had the same craving for a settlement
within its borders which we have met with
more than once among the followers of Theodoric,
presented themselves before the Patrician Orestes,
and demanded that one-third of the lands of
Italy should be assigned to them as a perpetual
inheritance. This was more than Orestes dared to
grant, and, on his refusal, Odovacar said to the
mercenaries: "Make me king and
I will obtain for you your desire".</p>

<p>(23d Aug., 476) The offer was accepted; Odovacar
was lifted high on a shield by the arms of stalwart
barbarians, and saluted as king by their unanimous
acclamations.</p>

<p>When the <i>fœderati</i> were gathered out of the
"Roman" army, there seems to have been nothing
left that was capable of making any real defence of
the Empire. The campaign, if such it may be called,
<a name="p102" id="p102"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 102</span>
between Odovacar and Orestes was of the shortest
and most perfunctory kind. Ticinum (<i>Pavia</i>), in
which Orestes had taken refuge, was taken, sacked,
and partly burnt by the barbarians. The Master of
the Soldiery himself fled to Placentia, but was there
taken prisoner and beheaded, only five days after
the elevation of Odovacar. A week later his brother
Paulus, who had not men enough to hold even the
strong city of Ravenna, was taken prisoner, and slain
in the great pine-forest outside that city. At Ravenna
the young puppet-Emperor, Romulus, was also
taken prisoner. The barbarian showed himself more
merciful, perhaps also more contemptuous, towards
his boy-rival than was the custom of the Emperors
of Rome and Constantinople towards the sons of
their competitors. Odovacar, who pitied the tender
years of Augustulus, and looked with admiration
on his beautiful countenance, spared his life and
assigned to him for a residence the palace and gardens
of Lucullus, the conqueror of Mithridates, who
five and a half centuries before had prepared for
himself this beautiful home (the Lucullanum) in the
very heart of the lovely Bay of Naples. The building
and the fortifying of a great commercial city
have utterly altered the whole aspect of the bay, but
in the long egg-shaped peninsula, on which stands
to-day the Castel dell' Ovo, we can still see the outlines
of the famous Lucullanum, in which the last
Roman Emperor of Rome ended his inglorious
days. His conqueror generously allowed him a
pension of £3,600 per annum, but for how long this
pension continued to be a charge on the revenues of
<a name="p103" id="p103"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 103</span>
the new kingdom we are unable to say. There is
one doubtful indication of his having survived his
abdication by about thirty years,<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a>
<a href="#footnote48"><sup class="sml">48</sup></a> but clear historical
notices of his subsequent life and of the date of
his death are denied us; a striking proof of the
absolute nullity of his character.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote48"
name="footnote48"></a><b>Footnote 48:</b><a href="#footnotetag48">
(return) </a>
I allude here to a letter in the Vanarum of Cassiodorus (iii., 35),
written between 504 and 525, and addressed to Romulus and his
mother. But we can by no means prove that this is Romulus
Augustulus.</blockquote>

<p>This then was the event which stands out in the
history of Europe as the "Fall of the Western Empire"
The reader will perceive that it was no great
and terrible invasion of a conquering host like the
Fall of the Eastern Empire in 1453; no sudden
overthrow of a national polity like the Norman Conquest
of 1066; not even a bloody overturning of the
existing order by demagogic force like the French
Revolution of 1792. It was but the continuance of a
process which had been going forward more or less
manifestly for nearly a century,--the recognition of
the fact that the <i>fœderati,</i> the so-called barbarian
mercenaries of Rome, were really her masters. If
we had to seek a parallel for the event of 476, we
should find it rather in the deposition of the last
Mogul Emperor at Delhi, and the public assumption
by the British Queen of the "Raj" over the greater
part of India, than in any of the other events to
which we have alluded.</p>

<p>Reflecting on this fact, and seeing that the Roman
Empire still lived on in the East for nearly a thousand
years, that the Eastern Cæsar never for many
<a name="p104" id="p104"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 104</span>
generations reliquished his claim to be considered
the legitimate ruler of the Old Rome, as well as of
the New, and sometimes asserted that claim in a
very real and effective manner, and considering too
that Charles the Great, when he (in modern phrase)
"restored the Western Empire" in 800, never professed
to be the successor of Romulus Augustulus,
but of Constantine VI., the then recently deposed
Emperor of the East; the latest school of historical
investigators, with scarcely an exception,
minimise the importance of the event of 476, and
some even object to the expression "Fall of the
Western Empire" as fitly describing it. The protest
is a sound one and was greatly needed. Perhaps
now the danger is in the other direction, and
there is a risk of our making too little of an event
in which after all the sceptre did manifestly depart
from Rome. During the whole interval between
Odovacar's accession and Belisarius' occupation of
Rome (476-536), no Roman, however proud or
patriotic, could blind himself to the fact that a man
of barbarian blood was the real, and in a certain
sense the supreme, ruler of his country. Ricimer
might be looked upon as an eminent servant of the
Emperor who had the misfortune to be of barbarian
birth. Odovacar and Theodoric were, without all
contradiction, kings; if not "kings of Italy", at any
rate "kings in Italy", sometimes actually making
war on the Cæsar of Byzantium, and not caring,
when they did so, to set up the phantom of a rival
Emperor in order to legitimise their opposition.
But in a matter so greatly debated as this it will be
<a name="p105" id="p105"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 105</span>
safer not to use our own or any modern words,
This is how Count Marcellinus, an official of the
Eastern Empire, writing his annals about fifty-eight
years after the deposition of Romulus, describes the
event: "Odovacar killed Orestes and condemned
his son Augustulus to the punishment of exile in
the Lucullanum, a castle of Campania. The Hesperian
(Western) Empire of the Roman people,
which Octavianus Augustus first of the Augusti
began to hold in the 709th year of the building of
the city (B.C. 44), perished with this Augustulus in
the 522d year of his predecessors (A.D. 476), the
kings of the Goths thenceforward holding both Rome
and Italy".<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a>
<a href="#footnote49"><sup class="sml">49</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote49"
name="footnote49"></a><b>Footnote 49:</b><a href="#footnotetag49">
(return) </a>
"Orestem Odoacer llico trucidavit, Augustulum filium Orestis

Hesperium Romana gentis imperium, quod septingentesimo nono
urbis condita anno primus Augustorum Octavianus Augustus
tenere cœpit, cum hoc Augustulo periit, anno decessorum regni Imperatorum
DXXII. Gothorum dehinc regibus Romam tenentibus". It will be
seen that there is an error of two years in the calculation.</blockquote>

<p>Of the details of Odovacar's rule in Italy we know
very little. Of course the <i>fœderati</i> had their will, at
any rate in some measure, with reference to the
assignment of land in Italy, but no historian has
told us anything as to the social disorganisation
which such a redistribution of property must have
produced. There are some indications that it was
not thoroughly carried into effect, at any rate in
the South of Italy, and that the settlements of the
<i>fœderati</i> were chiefly in the valley of the Po, and in
the districts since known as the Romagna.</p>

<p>The old Imperial machinery of government was
<a name="p106" id="p106"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 106</span>
taken over by the new ruler, and in all outward
appearance things probably went on under King
Odovacar much as they had done under Count
Ricimer. No great act of cruelty or oppression
stains the memory of Odovacar. He lost Provence
to the Visigoths, but, on the other hand, he by
judicious diplomacy recovered Sicily from the Vandals.
Altogether it is probable that Italy was, at
any rate, not more miserable under the sway of this
barbarian king than she had been at any time since
Alaric's invasion, in 408, proclaimed her helplessness
to the world.</p>

<p>One piece of solemn comedy is worth relating,
namely, the embassies despatched to Constantinople
by the rival claimants to the dominion of Italy. It
was probably towards the end of 477, or early
in 478, that Zeno, then recently returned from
exile after the usurpation of Basiliscus, received two
embassies from two deposed Emperors of the West.
First of all came the ambassadors of Augustulus, or
rather of the Roman Senate, sent nominally by the
orders of Augustulus, really by those of Odovacar.
These men, great Roman nobles, represented "that
they did not need an Emperor of their own. One
absolute ruler was sufficient to guard both East and
West; but they had, moreover, chosen Odovacar,
who was well able to protect their interests, being a
man wise in counsel and brave in war. They therefore
prayed the Emperor to bestow on him the
dignity of Patrician, and to entrust to him the
administration of the affairs of Italy". At the same
time (apparently) they brought the ornaments of
<a name="p107" id="p107"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 107</span>
the Imperial dignity, the diadem, the purple robe,
the jewelled buskins, which had been worn by all
the "Shadow Emperors" who flitted across the
stage, and requested that they might be laid up
in the Imperial palace at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Simultaneously there came ambassadors from Nepos,
the Imperial refugee, the nephew by marriage of
Verina. From his Dalmatian exile he congratulated
his kinsman Zeno on his recent restoration to the
throne, and begged him to lend men and money
to bring about the like happy result for him by
replacing him on the Western throne.</p>

<p>To these embassies Zeno returned ambiguous answers,
which seemed to leave the question as to the
legitimacy of Odovacar's rule an open one. The
Senate were sharply rebuked for having acquiesced
in the dethronement of Nepos, and a previous
Emperor who had been sent to them from the
East.<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a>
<a href="#footnote50"><sup class="sml">50</sup></a> Odovacar was recommended to seek the coveted
dignity from Nepos, and to co-operate for his
return. At the same time, the moderation of Odovacar's
rule, and his desire to conform himself to the
maxims of Roman civilisation, received the Emperor's
praise. The nature of the reply to Nepos is
not recorded, but it was no doubt made plain to him
that sympathy and good wishes were all that he
would receive from his Eastern colleague. The
letters addressed to Odovacar bore the superscription
"To the <i>Patrician</i> Odovacar", and that was all
that the barbarian really cared for. With such a
title as this, every act, even the most high-handed,
<a name="p108" id="p108"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 108</span>
on the part of the barbarian king was rendered
legitimate. Nepos and Augustulus were equally
excluded as useless encumbrances to the state,
and the kings <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> became practically
one man, and that man Odovacar.</p>

<br>


<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/029.png">he friendly relations between Odovacar
and the Eastern Emperor
which had been established by
the embassy last described were
gradually altered into estrangement.
In the year 480, Nepos,
the dethroned Emperor of Rome,
was stabbed by two treacherous
courtiers in his palace near Salona.
Odovacar led an army into Dalmatia,
and avenged the murder, but also apparently
annexed the province of Dalmatia to his
<a name="p110" id="p110"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 110</span>
dominion, thus coming into nearer neighbourhood
with Constantinople (487-488) This may have been one
cause of alienation, but a more powerful one
was the negotiation which was commenced in the
year 484 between Odovacar and Illus, the last of
the many insurgent generals who disturbed the
reign of Zeno. At first Odovacar held himself aloof
from the proposed confederacy, but afterwards (486)
he was disposed, or Zeno believed that he was disposed,
to accept the alliance of the insurgent general.
In order to find him sufficient occupation
nearer home, the Emperor fanned into a flame the
smouldering embers of discord between Odovacar
and Feletheus, king of the Rugians, the most powerful
ruler of those Danubian lands from which the
Italian king himself had migrated into Italy.
The Rugian war was short, and Odovacar's
success was decisive. In 487 he vanquished
the Rugian army and carried Feletheus and his wife
prisoners to Ravenna. In 488 an attempt to raise
again the standard of the Rugian monarchy, which
was made by Frederic, the son of Feletheus, was
crushed, and Frederic, an exile and a fugitive, betook
himself to the camp of Theodoric, who was
then dwelling at Novæ (<i>Sistova?</i>), on the Danube.</p>

<p>When the attempt to weaken Odovacar by means
of his fellow-barbarians in "Rugiland" failed, Zeno
feigned outward acquiescence, offering congratulations
on the victory and receiving presents out of
the Rugian spoils, but in his heart he felt that there
must now be war to the death between him and this
too powerful ruler of Italy. The news came to him
<a name="p111" id="p111"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 111</span>
at a time when Theodoric was in one of his most
turbulent and destructive moods, when he had penetrated
within fourteen miles of Constantinople and had
fired the towns and villages of Thrace, perhaps even
within sight of the capital. It was a natural thought
and not altogether an unstatesmanlike expedient to
play off one disturber of his peace against the other,
to commission Theodoric to dethrone the "tyrant"
Odovacar, and thus at least earn repose for the
provincials of Thrace, perhaps secure an ally at Ravenna.
Theodoric, we may be sure, with those instincts
of civilisation and love for the Empire which
had been in his heart from boyhood, though often
repressed and disobeyed, needed little exhortation
to an enterprise which he may himself have suggested
to the Emperor.</p>

<p>Thus then it came to pass that a formal interview
was arranged between Emperor and King (perhaps
at Constantinople, though it seems doubtful
whether Theodoric could have safely trusted himself
within its walls), and at this interview the terms of
the joint enterprise were arranged, an enterprise to
which Theodoric was to contribute all the effective
strength and Zeno the glamour of Imperial
legitimacy.</p>

<p>When the high contracting parties met, Theodoric
lamented the hapless condition of Italy and Rome:
Italy once subject to the predecessors of Zeno;
Rome, once the mistress of the world, now harassed
and distressed by the usurped authority of a king of
Rugians and Turcilingians. If the Emperor would
send Theodoric thither with his people, he would be
<a name="p112" id="p112"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 112</span>
at once relieved from the heavy charges of their
<i>stipendia</i> which he was now bound to furnish, while
Theodoric would hold the land as of the free gift of
the Emperor, and would reign there as king, only till
Zeno himself should arrive to claim the supremacy<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a>
<a href="#footnote51"><sup class="sml">51</sup></a>.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote51"
name="footnote51"></a><b>Footnote 51:</b><a href="#footnotetag51">
(return) </a> The account of this important interview is combined from two
sources: Jordanes, the Gothic historian, who naturally magnifies
Theodoric's share in the inception of the enterprise; and a chronicler
known as "Anonymus Valesii", who evidently writes in the interest
of Zeno. It is from the latter only that we have any hint of an
intended visit of Zeno to Italy, a visit which certainly never took
place. Procopius, who also writes from the Byzantine point of view,
attributes the conception of the design to Zeno.</blockquote>

<p>In the autumn of the year 488, Theodoric with
all his host set forth from Sistova on the Danube on
his march to Italy. His road was the same taken by
Alaric and by most of the barbarian invaders; along
the Danube as far as Belgrade, then between the
rivers Drave and Save or along the banks of one of
them till he reached the Julian Alps (not far from
the modern city of Laibach), then down upon Aquileia
and the Venetian plain. As in the Macedonian
campaign, so now, he was accompanied by all the
members of his nation, old men and children, mothers
and maidens, and doubtless by a long train of
waggons. We have no accurate information whatever
as to the number of his army, but various indications,
both in earlier and later history, seem to
justify us in assuming that the soldiers must have
numbered fully 40,000; and if this was the case,
the whole nation cannot have been less than 200,000.
The difficulty of finding food for so great a multitude
in the often desolated plains of Pannonia and
<a name="p113" id="p113"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 113</span>
Noricum must have been enormous, and was no doubt
the reason of the slowness of Theodoric's progress.
Very probably he divided his army into several portions,
moving on parallel lines; foragers would scour
the country far and wide, stores of provisions would
be accumulated in the great Gothic waggons, which
would be laboriously driven over the rough mountain
passes. Then all the divisions of the army which
had scattered in search of food would have to concentrate
again when they came into the neighbourhood
of an enemy, whether Odovacar or one of the
barbarian kings who sought to bar their progress.
All these operations consumed much time, and
hence it was that though the Goths started on their
pilgrimage in 488 (probably in the autumn of that
year) they did not descend into the plains of Italy
even at its extreme north-eastern corner, till July,
489.</p>

<p>There was one fact which probably facilitated the
progress of Theodoric, and prevented his expedition
with such a multitude from being condemned
as absolute foolhardiness. His road lay, for
the most part, through regions with which he was
already well acquainted, through a land which might
almost be called his native land, and both the resources
and the difficulties of which were well known
to him. The first considerable city that he came to,
Singidunum (the modern Belgrade), was the scene
of his own first boyish battle. The Gepidæ, who
were his chief antagonists on the road, had swarmed
over into that very province of Pannonia where his
father's palace once stood; and though they showed
<a name="p114" id="p114"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 114</span>
themselves bitter foes, they were doubtless surrounded
by foes of their own who would be friends
to the Ostrogoths. Probably, too, Frederic, the
Rugian refugee, brought with him many followers
who knew the road and could count on the assistance
of some barbarian allies, eager to overturn the
throne of Odovacar. Thus it will be seen that
though the perils of the Ostrogothic march were
tremendous, the danger which in those mapless
days was so often fatal to an invading army--ignorance
of the country--was not among them.</p>

<p>We are vaguely told of countless battles fought
by the Ostrogoths with Sclavonic and other tribes
that lay across their line of march, but the only
battle of which we have any details (and those only
such as we can extract from the cloudy rhetoric of a
popular preacher<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a>
<a href="#footnote52"><sup class="sml">52</sup></a>) is one which was fought with
the Gepidse, soon after the Goths had emerged from
the territory of the friendly Empire, near the great
mere or river which went by the name of Hiulca
Palus, in what is now the crown-land of Sclavonia.
When the great and over-wearied multitude approached
the outskirts of the Gepid territory,
their leader sent an embassy to Traustila, king
of the Gepidæ, entreating that his host might have
an unmolested passage, and offering to pay for the
provisions which they would require. To this embassy
Traustila returned a harsh and insulting
answer: "He would yield no passage through his
dominions to the Ostrogoths; if they would go by
<a name="p115" id="p115"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 115</span>
that road they must first fight with the unconquered
Gepidæ" Traustila then took up a strong position
near the Hiulca Palus, whose broad waters, girdled
by fen and treacherous morass, made the onward
march of the invaders a task of almost desperate
danger. But the Ostrogoths could not now retreat;
famine and pestilence lay behind them on their
road; they must go forward, and with a reluctant
heart Theodoric gave the signal for the battle.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote52"
name="footnote52"></a><b>Footnote 52:</b><a href="#footnotetag52">
(return) </a> Ennodius, Bishop of Pavia, whose Panegyric on Theodoric,
spoken about 506, is our chief authority for this part of the history.</blockquote>

<p>It seemed at first as if that battle would be lost,
and as if the name and fame of the Ostrogothic people
would be swallowed up in the morasses of the
reedy Hiulca. Already the van of the army, floundering
in the soft mud, and with only their wicker
shields to oppose to the deadly shower of the Gepid
arrows, were like to fall back in confusion. Then
Theodoric, having called for a cup of wine, and
drunk to the fortunes of his people, in a few spirited
words called to his soldiers to follow his standard--the
standard of a king who would carve out the way
to victory. Perchance he may have discerned some
part of the plain where the road went over solid
ground, and if that were beset by foes, at any rate
the Gepid was less terrible than the morass. So it
was that he charged triumphantly through the
hostile ranks, and, being followed by his eager warriors,
achieved a signal victory. The Gepidæ were
soon wandering over the plain, a broken and dispirited
force. Multitudes of them were slain before
the descent of night saved the remaining fugitives,
and so large a number of the Gepid store-waggons
fell into the hands of the Ostrogoths that throughout
<a name="p116" id="p116"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 116</span>
the host one voice of rejoicing arose that
Traustila had been willing to fight. So had a little
Gothic blood bought food more than they could
ever have afforded money to purchase.</p>

<p>Thus, through foes and famine, hardships of the
winter and hardships of the summer, the nation-army
held on its way, and at length (as has been already
said) in the month of August (489) the last of the
waggons descended from the highlands, which are an
outpost of the Julian Alps, and the Ostrogoths were
encamped on the plains of Italy. Odovacar, who apparently
had allowed them to accomplish the passage
of the Alps unmolested, stood ready to meet them
on the banks of the Isonzo, the river which flows
near the ruins of the great city of Aquileia. He had
a large army, the kernel of which would doubtless be
those mercenaries who had raised him on the shield
thirteen years before, and among whom he had divided
one-third part of the soil of Italy. But many
other barbarians had flocked to his standard, so that
he had, as it were, a little court of kings, chieftains
serving under him as supreme leader. He himself,
however, was now in the fifty-sixth year of his age,
and his genius for war, if he ever had any, seems to
have failed him. He fought (as far as we can discern
his conduct from the fragmentary notices of the annalists
and panegyrists) with a sort of sullen savageness,
like a wild beast at bay, but without skill either of
strategy or tactics. The invaders, encumbered with
the waggons and the non-combatants, had greatly
the disadvantage of position. Odovacar's camp had
been long prepared, was carefully fortified, and protected
<a name="p117" id="p117"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 117</span>
by the deep and rapid Isonzo. But Theodoric's
soldiers succeeded in crossing the river, stormed
the camp, defended as it was by a strong earthen
rampart, and sent its defenders flying in wild rout
over the plains of Venetia. Odovacar fell back on
the line of the Adige, and the beautiful north-eastern
corner of Italy, the region which includes among its
cities Udine, Venice, Vicenza, Padua, now accepted
without dispute the rule of Theodoric, and perhaps
welcomed him as a deliverer from the stern sway of
Odovacar.<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a>
<a href="#footnote53"><sup class="sml">53</sup></a> From this time forward it is allowable
to conjecture that the most pressing of Theodoric's
anxieties, that which arose from the difficulty of
feeding and housing the women and children of his
people, if not wholly removed was greatly lightened.
Odovacar took up a strong position near Verona,
separated from that city by the river Adige.
Theodoric, though not well provided with warlike
appliances,<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a>
<a href="#footnote54"><sup class="sml">54</sup></a> rightly judged that it was of supreme
importance to his cause to follow up with rapidity
the blow struck on the banks of the Isonzo, and
accordingly, towards the end of September, he, with
his army, stood before the <i>fossatum</i> or entrenched
camp at Verona. In order to force his soldiers to
fight bravely, Odovacar had, in defiance of the ordinary
rules of war, placed his camp where retreat was
almost hopelessly barred by the swift stream of the
Adige, and he addressed his army with stout words
<a name="p118" id="p118"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 118</span>
full of simulated confidence in victory. On the
morning of the 30th of September, when the two
armies were about to join in what must evidently be a
most bloody encounter, the mother and sister of
Theodoric, Erelieva and Amalfrida, sought his presence
and asked him with some anxiety what were the
chances of the battle. With words, reminding us of
the Homeric saying that "the best omen is to
fight bravely for one's country", Theodoric reassured
their doubting hearts. On that day, he told his
mother, it was for him to show that she had given
birth to a hero on the day when the Ostrogoths did
battle with the Huns. Dressed in his most splendid
robes, those robes which their hands had adorned
with bright embroidery, he would be conspicuous
both to friend and foe, and would give a noble spoil
to his conqueror if any man could succeed in slaying
him. With these words he leapt on his horse, rushed
to the van, cheered on his wavering troops, and began
a series of charges, which at length, but not till
thousands of his own men as well as of the enemy
were slain, carried the <i>fossatum</i> of Odovacar.</p>

<p>The battle once gained, of course the dispositions
which Odovacar had made to ensure the resistance of
his soldiers, necessitated their ruin, and the swirling
waters of the Adige probably destroyed as many
as the Ostrogothic sword. Odovacar himself, again
a fugitive, sped across the plain south-eastward to
Ravenna, compelled like so many Roman Emperors
before him to shelter himself from the invader behind
its untraversable network of rivers and canals.
It would seem from the scanty notices which remain
<a name="p119" id="p119"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 119</span>
to us that in this battle of Verona, the bloodiest and
most hardly fought of all the battles of the war, the
original army of <i>fœderati</i>, the men who had crowned
Odovacar king, and divided the third part of Italy
between them, was, if not annihilated, utterly broken
and dispirited, and Theodoric, who now marched
westward with his people, and was welcomed with
blessing and acclamations by the Bishop and citizens
of Milan, received also the transferred allegiance of
the larger part of the army of his rival.</p>

<p>It seemed as if a campaign of a few weeks had
secured the conquest of Italy, but the war was in
fact prolonged for three years and a half from this
time by domestic treachery, foreign invasion, and the
almost absolute impregnability of Ravenna.</p>

<p>I. At the head of the soldiers of Odovacar who
had apparently with enthusiasm accepted the leadership
of his younger and more brilliant rival, was a certain
Tufa, Master of the Soldiery among the <i>fœderati</i>
Either he had extraordinary powers of deception, or
Theodoric, short of generals, accepted his professions
of loyalty with most unwise facility; for so it was
that the Ostrogothic king entrusted to Tufa's generalship
the army which assuredly he ought to have
led himself to the siege of Ravenna. When Tufa
arrived at Faventia, about eighteen miles from Ravenna,
his old master came forth to meet him; the
instinct of loyalty to Odovacar revived (if indeed he
had not all along been playing a part in his alleged
desertion), and Tufa carried over, apparently, the
larger part of the army under his command to the
service of Theodoric's rival. Worst of all, he surrendered
<a name="p120" id="p120"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 120</span>
to his late master the chief members of his
staff the so-called <i>comites (henchmen)</i> of Theodoric
some of whom had probably helped him in his early
adventure against Singidunum, and had shared his
hardships in many a weary march through Thrace
and Macedonia. These men were all basely murdered
by Odovacar, a deed which Theodoric inwardly
determined should never be forgiven (492).</p>

<p>Such an event as the defection of Tufa, carrying
with him a considerable portion of his troops, was a
great blow to the Ostrogothic cause. Some time later
another and similar event took place. Frederic the
Rugian, whose father had been dethroned, and who
had been himself driven into exile by the armies of
Odovacar, for some unexplained and most mysterious
reason, quitted the service of Theodoric and
entered that of his own deadliest enemy. The sympathy
of scoundrels seems to have drawn him into a
special intimacy with Tufa, with whom he probably
wandered up and down through Lombardy (as we
now call it) and Venetia, robbing and slaying in the
name of Odovacar, but not caring to share his hardships
in blockaded and famine-stricken Ravenna.
Fortunately, the Nemesis which so often waits on the
friendship of bad men was not wanting in this case.
The two traitors quarrelled about the division of the
spoil and a battle took place between them,
in the valley of the Adige above Verona, in
which Tufa was slain. Frederic, with his Rugian
countrymen, occupied the strong city of Ticinum
<i>(Pavia)</i>, where they spent two dreadful years,
"Their minds", says an eye-witness,<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a>
<a href="#footnote55"><sup class="sml">55</sup></a> in after-time
<a name="p121" id="p121"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 121</span>
the Bishop of that city, "were full of cruel energy
which prompted them to daily crimes. In truth,
they thought that each day was wasted which they
had not made memorable by some sort of outrage".
In 494, with the general pacification of Italy, they
disappear from view: and we may conjecture, though
we are not told, that Pavia was taken, and that Frederic
received his deserts at the hands of Theodoric.</p>

<p>II. In the year 490 Gundobad, king of the Burgundians,
crossed the Alps and descended into Italy
to mingle in the fray as an antagonist of
Theodoric. In the same year, probably at
the same time, Alaric II., king of the Visigoths, entered
Italy as his ally. A great battle was fought on
the river Adda, ten miles east of Milan, in which
Odovacar, who had emerged from the shelter of Ravenna,
was again completely defeated. He fled once
more to Ravenna, which he never again quitted.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote55"
name="footnote55"></a><b>Footnote 55:</b><a href="#footnotetag55">
(return) </a> Ennodius (writing the life of Bishop Epiphanius).</blockquote>

<p>While these operations were proceeding, Theodoric's
own family and the non-combatants of the
Ostrogothic nation were in safe shelter, though in
somewhat narrow quarters, in the strong city of
Pavia, whose Bishop, Epiphanius, was the greatest
saint of his age, and one for whom Theodoric felt an
especial veneration. No doubt they must have left
that city before the evil-minded Rugians entered it
(492), but we hear nothing of the circumstances of
their flight or removal.</p>

<p>As for the Burgundian king, he does not seem to
have been guided by any high considerations of
policy in his invasion of Italy, and having been induced
to conclude a treaty with Theodoric, he returned
to his own royal city of Lyons with goodly
<a name="p122" id="p122"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 122</span>
spoil and a long train of hapless captives torn from
the fields of Liguria.</p>

<p>III. These disturbing elements being cleared away,
we may now turn our attention to the true key of
the position and the central event of the war, the
siege of Odovacar in Ravenna. After Tufa's second
change of sides, and during the Burgundian invasion
of Italy, there was no possibility of keeping up an
Ostrogothic blockade of the city of the marshes.
Odovacar emerged thence, won back the lower valley
of the Po, and marching on Milan, inflicted
heavy punishment on the city, for the welcome given
to Theodoric. In the battle of the Adda, 11 August,
490, however, as has been already mentioned, he sustained
a severe defeat, in which he lost one of his most
faithful friends and ablest counsellors, a Roman noble
named Pierius. After his flight to Ravenna, which
immediately followed the battle of the Adda, there
seems to have been a general movement throughout
Italy, headed by the Catholic clergy, for the purpose
of throwing off his yoke, and if we do not misread
the obscure language of the Panegyrist, this movement
was accompanied by a wide-spread popular
conspiracy, somewhat like the Sicilian Vespers of a
later day, to which the <i>fœderati</i>, the still surviving
adherents of Odovacar, scattered over their various
domains in Italy, appear to have fallen victims.</p>

<p>Only two cities, Cæsena and Rimini, beside Ravenna,
now remained to Odovacar, and for the next
two years and a half (from the autumn of 490 to the
spring of 493) Ravenna was straitly besieged. Corn
rose to a terrible famine price (seventy-two shillings
<a name="p123" id="p123"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 123</span>
a peck), and before the end of the siege the inhabitants
had to feed on the hides of animals, and all
sorts of foul and fearful aliments, and many of
them perished of hunger. A sortie made in 491
by a number of barbarian recruits whom Odovacar
had by some means attracted to his standard, was
repelled after a desperate encounter. During all this
time Theodoric, from his entrenched camp in the
great pine-wood of Ravenna, was watching jealously
to see that no provisions entered the city by land,
and in 492, after taking Rimini, he brought a fleet of
swift vessels thence to a harbour about six miles from
Ravenna, and thus completed its investment by sea.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 493 the misery of the besieged
city became unendurable, and Odovacar, with infinite
reluctance, began to negotiate for its surrender.
His son Thelane was handed over as a
hostage for his fidelity, and the parleying between
the two rival chiefs began on the 25th of February.
On the following day Theodoric and his Ostrogoths
entered Classis, the great naval emporium, about
three miles from the city; and on the 27th, by the
mediation of the Bishop, peace was formally concluded
between the warring kings.</p>

<p>The peace, the surrender of the city, the acceptance
of the rule of "the new King from the East", were
apparently placed under the especial guardianship
of the Church. "The most blessed man, the Archbishop
John", says a later ecclesiastical historian,<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a>
<a href="#footnote56"><sup class="sml">56</sup></a>
"opened the gates of the city, 5 March, 493, which
<a name="p124" id="p124"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 124</span>
Odovacar had closed, and went forth with crosses and
thuribles and the Holy Gospels, seeking peace. While
the priests and the rest of the clergy round him intoned
the psalms, he, falling prostrate on the ground, obtained
that which he desired. He welcomed the new
King coming from the East, and peace was granted
unto him, including not only the citizens of Ravenna,
but all the other Romans<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a>
<a href="#footnote57"><sup class="sml">57</sup></a>, for whom the blessed John made entreaty".</p>

of Italy</blockquote>

<p>The chief clause of the treaty was that which
assured Odovacar not only life but absolute equality
of power with his conqueror. The fact that Theodoric
should have, even in appearance, consented to an
arrangement so precarious and unstable, is the strongest
testimony to the impregnability of Ravenna, which
after three years' strict blockade, could still be won
only by so mighty a concession. But of course there
was not, there could not be, any real peace on such
terms between the two queen-bees in that swarming
hive of barbarians. Theodoric received information--so
we are told--that his rival was laying snares for
his life, and being determined to anticipate the blow,
invited Odovacar to a banquet at "the Palace of the
Laurel-grove", on the south-east of the city (15th
March, 493). When Odovacar arrived, two suppliants
knelt before him and clasped his hands while
offering a feigned petition. Some soldiers who had
been stationed in two side alcoves stepped forth
from the ambush to slay him, but at the last moment
their hearts failed them, and they could not strike.
If the deed was to be done, Theodoric must himself
<a name="p125" id="p125"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 125</span>
be the executioner or the assassin. He raised his
sword to strike. "Where is God?" cried the defenceless
but unterrified victim. "Thus didst thou
to my friends", answered Theodoric, reminding him
of the treacherous murder of the "henchmen".
Then with a tremendous "stroke of his broadsword
he clove his rival from the shoulder to the loin. The
barbarian frenzy, which the Scandinavian minstrels
call the "fury of the Berserk", was in his heart, and
with a savage laugh at his own too impetuous blow,
he shouted as the corpse fell to the ground: "I think
the weakling had never a bone in his body".</p>

<p>The body of Odovacar was laid in a stone coffin,
and buried near the synagogue of the Jews. His
brother was mortally wounded while attempting to
escape through the palace-garden. His wife died of
hunger in her prison. His son, sent for safe-keeping
to the king of the Visigoths in Gaul, afterwards
escaped to Italy and was put to death by the orders
of Theodoric. Thus perished the whole short-lived
dynasty of the captain of the <i>fœderati</i>.</p>

<p>In his long struggle for the possession of Italy,
Theodoric had shown himself patient in adversity,
moderate in prosperity, brave, resourceful, and enduring.
But the memory of all these noble deeds
is dimmed by the crime which ended the tragedy, a
crime by the commission of which Theodoric sank
below the level of the ordinary morality of the barbarian,
breaking his plighted word, and sinning against
the faith of hospitality.</p>

<br>


<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/031.png">hus far we have followed the fortunes
of a Teutonic warrior of the
fifth century of our era, marking
his strange vacillations between
friendship and enmity to the great
civilised Empire under the shattered
fabric whereof he and his
people were dwelling, and neither
concealing nor extenuating any of
his lawless deeds, least of all that deed of treachery
and violence by which he finally climbed to the pinnacle
of supreme power in Italy. Now, for the next thirty
years, we shall have to watch the career of this same
man, ruling Italy with unquestioned justice and wise
<a name="p127" id="p127"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 127</span>
forethought, making the welfare of every class of his
subjects the end of all his endeavours, and cherishing
civilisation (or, as it was called in the language of his
chosen counsellors, <i>civilitas</i>) with a love and devotion
almost equal to that which religious zeal kindles in the
hearts of its surrendered votaries.</p>

<p>The transformation is a marvellous one. Success
and unquestioned dominion far more often deprave
and distort than ennoble and purify the moral nature
of man. But something like this transformation was
seen when Octavian, the crafty and selfish intriguer,
ripened into the wise and statesmanlike Augustus.
Nor have our own days been quite ignorant of a
similar phenomenon, when the stern soldier-politician
of Germany, the man who once seemed to
delight in war and whose favourite motto had till then
been "blood and iron" having secured for his master
the hegemony of Europe, strove (or seems to have
striven), during twenty difficult years, to maintain
peace among European nations, like one convinced
in his heart that War is the supreme calamity for
mankind.</p>

<p>It is a threadbare saying, "Happy is the nation
that has no annals", and the miserable historians of
the time tell us far too little about the thirty years
of peace which Italy enjoyed under the wise rule of
Theodoric; still we are told enough to enable us in
some degree to understand both what he accomplished
and how he accomplished it. And one
thing which makes us accept the statements of these
historians with unquestioning belief is that they
have no motive for the praises which they so freely
<a name="p128" id="p128"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 128</span>
bestow on the great Ostrogoth. They are not his
countrymen, nor his fellow-religionists. Our chief
authorities are Roman and Orthodox, and bitterly
condemn Theodoric for the persecution of the
Catholics, into which, as we shall see, he was provoked
in the last two years of his reign. Still, over
the grave of this dead barbarian and heretic, when
they have nothing to gain by speaking well of him,
they cannot forbear to praise the noble impartiality
and anxious care for the welfare of his people, which,
for the space of one whole generation, gave happiness
to Italy. It will be well to quote here one
or two of these testimonies, borne by impartial
witnesses.</p>

<p>Our chief authority,<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a>
<a href="#footnote58"><sup class="sml">58</sup></a> who is believed to have
been a Catholic Bishop of Ravenna, says:</p>

<p>"He was an illustrious man, and full of good-will
towards all. He reigned thirty-three (really thirty-two)
years, and during thirty of these years so great
was the happiness of Italy that even the wayfarers
were at peace. For he did nothing wrong. So did
he govern the two nations, the Goths and Romans,
as if they were one people, belonging himself to the
Arian sect, yet he ordained that the civil administration
should remain for the Romans as it had been
under their Emperors. He gave presents and rations
to the people, yet, though he found the Treasury
ruined, he brought it round, by his own hard work,
into a flourishing state. He attempted nothing
(during these first thirty years) against the Catholic
faith. Exhibiting games in the circus and amphitheatre,
<a name="p129" id="p129"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 129</span>
he received from the Romans the names of
Trajan and Valentinian (the happy days of which
most prosperous Emperors he did in truth seek to
restore), and, at the same time, the Goths rendered
true obedience to their valiant King, according
to the Edict which he had promulgated for
them.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote58"
name="footnote58"></a><b>Footnote 58:</b><a href="#footnotetag58">
(return) </a> "Anonymus Valesii" (probably Bishop Maximian).</blockquote>

<p>"He gave one of his daughters in marriage to the
King of the Visigoths in Gaul, another to the son of
the Burgundian King; his sister to the King of the
Vandals, and his niece to the King of the Thuringians.
Thus he pleased all the nations round him,
for he was a lover of manufactures and a great
restorer of cities. He restored the aqueduct of
Ravenna, which Trajan had built; and again, after
a long interval, brought water into the city. He
completed, but did not dedicate, the palace, and finished
the porticoes round it. At Verona he erected
baths and a palace, and constructed a portico from
the gate to the palace. The aqueduct, which had
been long destroyed, he renewed, and brought in
water through it. He also surrounded the city with
new walls. At Ticinum (<i>Pavia</i>) too he built a palace,
baths, and an amphitheatre, and erected walls
round the city. On many other cities also he
bestowed similar benefits.</p>

<p>"Thus he so charmed the nations near him that
they entered into a league with him, hoping that he
would be their King. The merchants, too, from divers
provinces, flocked to his dominions, for so great was
the order which he maintained, that if any one wished
to leave gold or silver on his land (in his country
<a name="p130" id="p130"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 130</span>
house) it was as safe as in a walled city. A proof of
this was the fact that he never made gates for any-city
of Italy, and the gates already existing were not
closed. Any one who had business to transact could
do it as safely by night as by day.</p>

<p>"In his time men bought wheat at 60 pecks for
a <i>solidus</i> (12 shillings a quarter), and 30 amphoræ of
wine for the same price (2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a gallon)".</p>

<p>So far the supposed Bishop of Ravenna. Now
let us hear Procopius, an official in the Imperial
army which brought the Ostrogothic kingdom to
ruin:</p>

<p>"Theodoric was an extraordinary lover of justice,
and adhered rigorously to the laws. He guarded
the country from barbarian invasions, and displayed
the greatest intelligence and prudence. There was in
his government scarcely a trace of injustice towards
his subjects, nor would he permit any of those under
him to attempt anything of the kind, except that
the Goths divided among themselves the same proportion
of the land of Italy which Odovacar had
allotted to his partisans. Thus then Theodoric was
in name a tyrant (that is, an irregular, because
barbarian, ruler), but in deed a true King (or Emperor),
not inferior to the best of his predecessors,
and his popularity grew greatly, both among Goths
and Italians, and this fact (that he was popular with
both nations) was contrary to the ordinary fashion
of human affairs. For generally, as different classes
in the State want different things, the government
which pleases one party has to incur the odium of
those who do not belong to it.</p>

<a name="p131" id="p131"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 131</span>
<p>"After a reign of thirty-seven years
<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a>

<p>So much for the general aspect of Theodoric's
rule in Italy. Now let us consider rather more in
detail what was his precise position in that country.
And first as to the title by which he was known. It
is singularly difficult to say what this title was. It
is quite clear that Theodoric never claimed to be
Emperor of the West, the successor of Honorius
and Augustulus. But there are grave reasons for
doubting whether he called himself, as has been
often stated, "King of Italy". In the fifth century
territorial titles of this kind were, if not absolutely
unknown, at least very uncommon. The various
Teutonic rulers generally took their titles from the
nations whom they led to battle, Gaiseric being
"King of the Vandals and Alans", Gundobad, "King
of the Burgundians", Clovis, "King of the Franks",
and so forth. Upon the whole, it seems most probable
that Theodoric's full title was "<i>King of the
Goths and Romans in Italy</i>"<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a>
<a href="#footnote60"><sup class="sml">60</sup></a> and that the allusion to
"Romans" in his title explains some of the conflict of
testimony as to the source from whence he derived
his title of King. It is quite true that a Teutonic
sovereign like Theodoric, sprung from a long line of
royal ancestors, and chosen by the voice of his people
to succeed their king, his father, would not need,
<a name="p132" id="p132"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 132</span>
and except under circumstances of great national
humiliation would not accept, any grant of the
kingly title, as ruler over his own nation, from the
Augustus at New Rome. But when it came to
claiming by the same title the obedience of Romans
as well as Goths, especially in that country which
had once been the heart of the Empire,--Theodoric,
King of the Goths, might well be anxious to strain all
the resources of diplomacy in order to obtain from
the legitimate head of the Roman world the confirmation
of those important words "and Romans",
which appeared in his regal title.<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a>

of both theories.</blockquote>

<p>In the year 490, probably soon after the battle of
the Adda, Theodoric sent Faustus, an eminent Roman
noble and "Chief of the Senate", on an embassy
to Zeno, "hoping that he might receive from
that Emperor permission to clothe himself with the
royal mantle". It will be remembered that in the
compact between Roman and Teuton, which preceded
Theodoric's invasion of Italy, words had been
used which implied that he was only to rule as
"locum tenens" of the Emperor till he himself
should arrive to claim the supremacy. Now, with
that conquest apparently almost completed, and with
his rival fast sealed up in Ravenna, Theodoric sends
a report of his success of the enterprise undertaken
"on joint account", and desires to legalise his position
<a name="p133" id="p133"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 133</span>
by a formal grant of the mantle of royalty
from the Autocrat of the World.</p>

<p>The time of the arrival of Theodoric's embassy at
Constantinople was unpropitious, as the Emperor
Zeno was already stricken by mortal illness. On the
9th of April, 491, he died, and was succeeded by the
handsome but elderly life-guardsman, Anastasius, to
whom Ariadne, widow of Zeno, gave her hand in marriage.
The rights and duties which pertained to the
compact between Theodoric and Zeno were perhaps
considered as of only personal obligation. It might
plausibly be contended by the Emperor's successor
that he was not bound to recognise the new royalty of
his predecessor's, "filius in arma", and by Theodoric
that the conditional estate in Italy granted to him
to hold "till Zeno should himself arrive" became absolute,
now that by the death of Zeno that event was
rendered impossible. However this may be, we hear
no more of negotiations between the Gothic camp
and the Court of Constantinople till the death of
Odovacar(493). Then the Goths, apparently in some
great assembly of the nation, "confirmed Theodoric
to themselves as King", without waiting for the
orders of the new Emperor.<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a>
<a href="#footnote62"><sup class="sml">62</sup></a> Whatever this ceremony
may have imported, it must have in some way
conferred on Theodoric a fuller kingship, perhaps
more of a territorial and less of a tribal sovereignty
than he had possessed when he was wandering with
his followers over the passes of the Balkans.</p>

<p>Though Theodoric had not consulted the Emperor
<a name="p134" id="p134"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 134</span>
before taking this step, he sent an ambassador,
again Faustus, who now held the important post of
"Master of the Offices",<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a>
<a href="#footnote63"><sup class="sml">63</sup></a> to Constantinople, probably
in order to give a formal notification of his self-assumed

<p>No messages or embassies, however, could yet
soothe the wounded pride of Anastasius. There
was deep resentment at the Eastern Court, and for
three or four years there seems to have been a
rupture of diplomatic relations between Constantinople
and Ravenna. At length, in the year 497,
Theodoric sent another ambassador, Festus, (also an
eminent Roman noble and Chief of the Senate,) to
Anastasius. This messenger, more successful than
his predecessor, "made peace with Anastasius concerning
Theodoric's premature assumption of royalty,
and brought back all the ornaments of the
palace which Odovacar had transmitted to Constantinople".<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a>

<p>(497) This final ratification of the Ostrogoth's sovereignty
in Italy is so vaguely described to us that it is
difficult to see how much it may have implied.
Probably it was to a certain extent convenient
to both parties that it should be left vague. The
Emperor would not abandon any hope, however
<a name="p135" id="p135"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 135</span>
shadowy, of one day winning back full possession of
"the Hesperian kingdom". The King might hope
that, in the course of years or generations, he himself,
or his descendants, might sever the last link of
dependence on Constantinople, perhaps might one
day establish themselves as full-blown Emperors of
Rome. The claims thus left in vagueness were the
seeds of future difficulties, and bore fruit forty years
later in a bloody and desolating war, but meanwhile
the position, as far as we can ascertain it, seems to
have been something like this. Theodoric, "King of
the Goths and Romans in Italy", was absolute ruler
of the country <i>de facto</i>, except in so far as the
Gothic nation, assembled under arms at its periodical
parades, may have exercised some check on his
full autocracy. He made peace and war, he nominated
the high officers of state, even one of the two
Consuls, who still kept alive the fiction of the Roman
Republic; he probably regulated the admissions
to the Senate; he was even in the last resort arbiter
of the fortunes of the Roman Church.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he did not himself coin gold
or silver money with his effigy; but in this he
was not singular, for it was not till a generation
or two had elapsed that any of the new barbarian
royalties thought it worth while to claim this
attribute of sovereignty. Though dressed in the
purple of royalty, by assuming the title of King
only, he accepted a position somewhat lower than
that of the Emperor of the New Rome. He sent
the names of the Consuls whom he had appointed to
Constantinople, an act which might be represented
<a name="p136" id="p136"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 136</span>
as a mere piece of formal courtesy, or as a request
for their ratification, according to the point of view
of the narrator. With a similar show of courtesy, or
submission, the accession of Theodoric's descendants
to the throne was, when the occasion arose,
notified to the then reigning Emperor. And there
were many limitations which the good sense and
statesmanlike feeling of the Ostrogothic king imposed
on his exercise of the royal power, but
which might be, perhaps were, represented as
part of the fundamental compact between him
and the Emperor of Rome. Such were the employment
of men of Roman birth by preference,
in all the great offices of the state; absolute
impartiality between the rival creeds, Catholic and
Arian (to the latter of which Theodoric himself was
an adherent); and a determination to abstain as
much as possible from all fresh legislation which
might modify the rights and duties of the Roman
inhabitants of Italy, the legislative power being
chiefly exercised in order to provide for those new
cases which arose out of the settlement of so large
a number of new-comers of alien blood within the
borders of the land.</p>

<p>After all the attempts which have been made to
explain and to systematise the relation between the
new barbarian royalties and the old and tottering Empire,
much remains which is absolutely incapable of
definition, but perhaps an historical parallel, though
not strictly accurate, may somewhat aid our comprehension
of the subject. It is well-known how for
the first hundred years of the English <i>Raj</i> in India
<a name="p137" id="p137"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 137</span>
the power which actually resided in an association of
traders, the old East India Company, and which was
wielded under their orders by a Clive, a Hastings, or
a Wellesley, was theoretically vested in an Emperor,
the descendant of "the Great Mogul", who lived in
seclusion in his palace at Delhi, and who, though
nominally all-powerful, had really, as Macaulay has
said, "less power to help or to hurt than the youngest
civil servant of the Company". Now assuredly
Anastasius and Justin, the Imperial contemporaries
of Theodoric, were no mere phantoms of royalty,
like the last Mogul Emperors of Delhi, but as far as
actual efficacious share in the government of Italy
went, the parallel holds good. Such deference as
was paid to their name and authority was a mere
courteous form; the whole power of the State--subject,
as has been said, to the limitations still imposed
by the popular institutions of the Goths--was
gathered up in the hands of Theodoric.</p>

<p>What then, it may be said, was gained by keeping
up the fiction that Italy still formed part of the
Roman Empire, and that Theodoric ruled in any
sense as the delegate of the Emperor? For the
present, much (though at the cost of future entanglements
and complications), since it facilitated
that union of "Romania" and "Barbaricum", which
was the next piece of work obviously necessary for
Europe. If the reader will recur to that noble
sentence of Ataulfus, which was quoted in the introduction
to this book,<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a>
<a href="#footnote66"><sup class="sml">66</sup></a> he will see that the reasoning
of that great chieftain took this shape: "A
<a name="p138" id="p138"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 138</span>
Commonwealth must have laws. The Goths, accustomed
for generations to their tameless freedom,
have not acquired the habit of obedience to the
laws. Till they acquire that habit, the administration
of the State must be left in Roman hands, and
all the authority of the King must be used in defence
of Roman organisation".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote66"
name="footnote66"></a><b>Footnote 66:</b><a href="#footnotetag66">
(return) </a> See p. 4.</blockquote>

<p>These principles, though he may never have read
the passage of Orosius which expounded them, were
essentially the principles of Theodoric. So long as
he remained in antagonism to the Empire, he could
not reckon on the hearty co-operation of Roman
officials in the task of government. The brave,
through patriotism, and the cowardly, through fear
of coming retribution, would decline to be known as
his adherents, and would stand aloof from his work
of re-organization. But when it was known that
even the great Augustus at Constantinople, "Our
Lord Anastasius, Father of his Country" (as the
coins styled him), recognised the royalty of Theodoric,
and had in some sort confided to him the
government of Italy, all the great army of civil servants,
who performed the functions of that highly
specialised organism, the Roman State, could,
without fear and without reproach, accept office
under the new-comer, and could look forward again,
as they had done before, to a fortunate official career,
to the honours and emoluments which were the
recognised reward of the successful civil servant.</p>

<p>In the next chapter, I shall describe with a little
more detail the character and the duties of some of
these Roman officials. For the present we will
<a name="p139" id="p139"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 139</span>
rather consider the nature of the work which Theodoric
accomplished through their instrumentality.
We have already heard from a nearly contemporary
chronicler, the story of some of the great civilising
works which he wrought in the wasted land, the
aqueducts of Ravenna and Verona, the walls of
Verona and Pavia, the baths, the palace, and the
amphitheatre. More important for the great mass
of his subjects was the perfect security which he
gave to the merchant for his commerce, to the husbandman
for the fruit of his toil. Corn, as we have
seen, sank to the extraordinarily low price of twelve
shillings a quarter. But this low price did not mean,
as it might in our country, the depression of the
agricultural interest, through the rivalry of the foreign
producer. On the contrary, the great economic
symptom of Theodoric's reign--and under the circumstances
a most healthy symptom--was that Italy,
from a corn-importing became a corn-exporting
country. Under the old emperors, whose rule was a
most singular blending of autocracy and demagogy,
in fact a kind of crowned socialism, every nerve had
been strained to bring from Alexandria and Carthage
the corn which was distributed gratuitously to the
idle population of Rome. Under such hopeless
competition as this, together with the demoralising
influence of slave labour, large tracts of Italy had
actually gone out of cultivation. Now, by political
changes, the merit of which must not be claimed for
the Ostrogothic government, both Egypt and Africa
had become unavailable for the supply of the necessities
of Rome. Theodoric and his ministers may
<a name="p140" id="p140"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 140</span>
however be praised for that prevalence of order and
good government, which enabled the long prostrate
agriculture of Italy to spring up like grass after a
summer shower. The conditions of prosperity were
there, and only needed the removal of adverse influences
and mistaken benevolence to bring forth their
natural fruit. The grain-largesses to the people of
Rome were indeed still continued in a modified
form, but the stores thus dispensed seemed to have
been brought almost entirely from Italy.<a id="footnotetag67" name="footnotetag67"></a>
<a href="#footnote67"><sup class="sml">67</sup></a> When
Gaul was visited with famine, the ship-masters along
the whole western coast of Italy were permitted
and encouraged to take the surplus of the Italian
crops to the suffering province. Even in a time of
dearth and after war had begun, corn was sold by
the State to the impoverished inhabitants of Liguria
at sixteen shillings a quarter.<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a>
<a href="#footnote68"><sup class="sml">68</sup></a> Altogether we
seem justified in asserting that the economic condition
of Italy, both as to the producers and the
consumers of its food-supplies, was more prosperous
under Theodoric than it had been for centuries
before, or than it was to be for centuries
afterwards.</p>

<p>I have already made some reference to Aqueducts,
which were among the noblest and most beneficial
works that any ruler of Italy could accomplish.
Ravenna, situated in an unhealthy swamp where
water fit for drinking was proverbially dearer than
<a name="p141" id="p141"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 141</span>
wine<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a>
<a href="#footnote69"><sup class="sml">69</sup></a> was pre-eminently dependent on such supplies
of the precious fluid as could be brought fresh and
sparkling from the distant Apennines. Theodoric
issued an order to all the farmers dwelling along the
course of the Aqueduct to eradicate the shrubs growing
by its side, which would otherwise fix their roots
in the bed of the stream, loosen the masonry, and
cause many a dangerous leak. "This being done",
said the Secretary of State, "we shall again have
baths that we may look upon with pleasure, water
which will cleanse, not stain, water after using
which we shall not require again to wash ourselves:
drinking-water, the mere sight of which will not
take away our appetite".<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a>
<a href="#footnote70"><sup class="sml">70</sup></a> Similar care was needed
to preserve the great Aqueducts which were the glory
of Imperial Rome, as even now their giant arches,
striding for miles over the desolate Campagna, are
her most impressive monument. At Rome also the
officer who was specially charged with the maintenance
of these noble works, the "Count of the Aqueducts",
was exhorted to show his zeal by rooting
up hurtful trees, and by at once repairing any part of
the masonry that seemed to be falling into decay
through age. He was warned against peculation
and against connivance at the frauds which often
marked the distribution of the water supply, and he
was assured that the strengthening of the Aqueducts
would constitute his best claim on the favour of his
sovereign.<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a>

<p>But while in most parts of Italy water is a boon
eagerly craved for, in some places it is a superabundance
and a curse. At Terracina on the Latian
coast there still stands in the piazza a slab of marble
with a long inscription, setting forth that "The
most illustrious lord and renowed king, Theodoric,
triumphant conqueror, ever Augustus, born for the
good of the Commonwealth, guardian of liberty and
propagator of the Roman name, subduer of the
nations", ordered that nineteen miles of the Appian
Way, being the portion extending from Three-bridges
<i>(Tripontium)</i> to Terracina should be cleared
of the waters which had flowed together upon it
from the marshes on either side. A nobleman of
the very highest rank, Consul, Patrician, and Prefect
of the City, Cæcina Maurus Basilius Decius, successfully
accomplished this work under the orders of his
sovereign, and for the safety thus afforded to travellers,
was rewarded by a large grant of the newly-drained
lands. <a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a>

<p>We have seen that Theodoric's anonymous panegyrist
calls him "a lover of manufactures and a great
restorer of cities". Of the manufactures encouraged
by the Ostrogothic king, we should have been glad
to receive a fuller account. All that I have been
able to discover in the published state-papers of
himself and his successors at all bearing on this
subject is some instructions with reference to the
opening of gold mines in Bruttii (the modern Calabria),
and iron mines in Dalmatia, a concession of
potteries to three senators, who are promised the
<a name="p143" id="p143"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 143</span>

<a href="#footnote73"><sup class="sml">73</sup></a> The whole tenour of these

<p>His zeal for the restoration of cities is by the same

find him giving orders for the transport of marble

offered to any accomplice who will assist in the discovery

<p>In all these counsels for the material well-being of
Italy, and for the repair of the ravages of anarchy
and war, Theodoric was undoubtedly much assisted
by his ministers of Roman extraction, some of whom
I shall endeavour to portray in a later chapter.
Still, though the details of the work may have been
theirs, it cannot be denied that the initiative was his.
A barbarian, thinking only barbarous thoughts, looking
upon war and the chase as the only employments
worthy of a free man, would not have chosen such
counsellors, and, if he had found them in his service,
would not have kept them. Therefore, remembering
those years of boyhood, which he passed at
Constantinople, at a time when the character is most
<a name="p145" id="p145"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 145</span>
susceptible of strong and lasting impressions, I cannot
doubt that notwithstanding the frequent relapses
into barbarism which marked his early manhood,
he was at heart a convert to civilisation, that
his desire was to obtain for "the Hesperian land"
all that he had seen best and greatest in the social
condition of the city by the Bosphorus, and that his
Secretary truly expressed his deepest and inmost
thoughts when he made him speak of himself as one
"whose whole care was to change everything for the
better.<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a>

<p>I shall close this chapter with a few anecdotes--far
too few have been preserved to us--which serve
to show what manner of man he appeared to his
contemporaries. Again I borrow from the anonymous
author, the supposed Bishop of Ravenna.</p>

<p>He was, we are told, unlettered,<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a>
<a href="#footnote79"><sup class="sml">79</sup></a> though fond
of the converse of learned men, and so clumsy with
his pen that after ten years of reigning he was still
unable to form without assistance the four letters
(THEO) which were affixed as his sign-manual to
documents issued in his name. In order to overcome
this difficulty he had a golden plate prepared
with the necessary letters perforated in it, and drew
his pen through the holes.<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a>
<a href="#footnote80"><sup class="sml">80</sup></a> But, though he was
unlettered, his shrewdness and mother-wit caused
both his sayings and doings to be much noted and
<a name="p146" id="p146"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 146</span>
remembered by his subjects. In one difficult case
which came before him, he discovered the truth
by a sudden device which probably reminded the
bystanders of the Judgment of Solomon, A young
man who as a child had been brought up by a
friend of his deceased father, returned to his home
and claimed a share of his inheritance from his
mother. She, however, was on the point of marriage
with a second husband, and under her suitor's
influence she disowned the son whom she had at first
welcomed with joy and had entertained for a month
in her house. As the suitor persisted in his demand
that the son should be turned out of doors, and the
son refused to leave his paternal abode, the case
came before the King's Court,<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a>
<a href="#footnote81"><sup class="sml">81</sup></a> where the widow
still persisted in her assertion that the young man
was not her son, but a stranger whom she had entertained
merely out of motives of hospitality. Suddenly
the king turned round upon her and said:
"This young man is to be thy husband, I command
thee to marry him". The horror-stricken mother
then confessed that he was indeed her son.</p>

<p>Some of Theodoric's sayings passed into proverbs
among the common people. One was: "He who
has gold and he who has a devil can neither of them
hide what he has got" Another: "The Roman
when in misery imitates the Goth and the Goth
in comfort imitates the Roman".</p>

<a name="p147" id="p147"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 147</span>

<p>We have unfortunately no description of the great
Ostrogoth's outward appearance, though the indications
in his history would lead us to suppose that he
was a man of stalwart form and soldierly bearing.
Nor is this deficiency adequately made up to us by
his coins, since, as has been already said, the gold
and silver pieces which were circulated in his reign
bore the impress of the Eastern Emperor, and the
miserable little copper coins which bear his effigy do
not pretend to portraiture.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>


<h3>ROMAN OFFICIALS--CASSIODORUS.</h3>

<p>The government of Italy still carried on according to Roman
precedent--Classification of the officials--The Consulship and the
Senate--Cassiodorus, his character and his work--His history of the
Goths--His letters and state papers.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/034.png"> have said that one of the most
important characteristics of Theodoric's
government of Italy was
that it was conducted in accordance
with the traditions of the Empire
and administered mainly by
officials trained in the Imperial
school. To a certain extent the
same thing is true of all the Teutonic
monarchies which arose in
the fifth century on the ruins of the Empire. In
dealing with the needs and settling the disputes of
the large, highly-organised communities, into whose
midst they had poured themselves, it was not possible,
<a name="p149" id="p149"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 149</span>
if it had been desirable, for the rulers to
remain satisfied with the simple, sometimes barbarous,
principles of law and administration which
had sufficed for the rude farmer-folk who dwelt
in isolated villages beyond the Rhine and the Danube.
Nor was this necessity disliked by the rulers
themselves. They soon perceived that the Roman
law, with its tendency to derive all power from the
Imperial head of the State, and the Roman official
staff, an elaborate and well-organised hierarchy, every
member of which received orders from one above him
and transmitted orders to those below, were far more
favourable to their own prerogative and gave them
a far higher position over against their followers and
comrades in war, than the institutions which had prevailed
in the forests of Germany. Hence, as I have
said, all the new barbarian royalties, even that of the
Vandals in Africa (in some respects more anti-Roman
than any other), preserved much of the laws and
machinery of the Roman Empire; but Theodoric's
Italian kingdom preserved the most of all. It might
in fact almost be looked upon as a mere continuation
of the old Imperial system, only with a strong, laborious,
martial Goth at the head of affairs, able and
willing to keep all the members of the official
hierarchy sternly to their work, instead of the
ruler whom the last three generations had been accustomed
to behold, a man decked with the purple
and diadem, but too weak, too indolent, too nervously
afraid of irritating some powerful captain of
<i>fœderati</i>, or some wealthy Roman noble, to be able
to do justice to all classes of his subjects.</p>

<a name="p150" id="p150"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 150</span>

<p>The composition of the official hierarchy of the
Empire is, from various sources,<a id="footnotetag82" name="footnotetag82"></a>
<a href="#footnote82"><sup class="sml">82</sup></a> almost as fully
known to us as that of any state of modern Europe.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote82"
name="footnote82"></a><b>Footnote 82:</b><a href="#footnotetag82">
(return) </a>
Chiefly the "Notitia Utriusque Imperii" (a sort of official Red-book of the time of Honorius,) but also the "Various Letters "of
Cassiodorus, to be described below.</blockquote>

<p>Pre-eminent in dignity over all the rest rose the "Illustrious" <i>Prætorian Prefect</i>, the vicegerent of the
sovereign, a man who held towards Emperor or King
nearly the same position which a Grand Vizier holds
towards a Turkish Sultan. Like his sovereign he
wore a purple robe (which reached however only
to his knees, not to his feet), and he drove through
the streets in a lofty official chariot. It was for him
to promulgate the Imperial laws, sometimes to put
forth edicts of his own. He proclaimed what taxes
were to be imposed each year, and their produce
came into his "Prætorian chest". He suggested to
his sovereign the names of the governors of the
provinces, paid them their salaries, and exercised a
general superintendence over them, having even
power to depose them from their offices. And
lastly, he was the highest Judge of Appeal in the
land, even the Emperor himself having generally no
power to reverse his sentences.</p>

<p>There was another "Illustrious" minister, who,
during this century both in the Eastern and Western
Empire, was always treading on the heels of the
Prætorian Prefect, and trying to rob him of some
portion of his power. This was the <i>Master of the
Offices</i> the intermediary between the sovereign and
the great mass of the civil servants, to whom the
<a name="p151" id="p151"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 151</span>
execution of his orders was entrusted. <i>A swarm of
Agentes in Rebus</i> (King's messengers, bailiffs, sheriff's
officers; we may call them by all these designations)
roved through the provinces, carrying into effect the
orders of the sovereign, always magnifying their
"master's" dignity, (whence they derived their epithet
of "Magistriani",) and seeking to depress the
Prætorian Cohorts, who discharged somewhat similar
duties under the Prætorian Prefect. The Master
of the Offices, besides sharing the counsels of his
sovereign in relation to foreign states, had also the
arsenals under his charge, and there was transferred
to him from his rival, the Prefect, the superintendence
of the <i>cursus publicus</i>, the great postal service
of the Empire.</p>

<p>Again, somewhat overlapping, as it seems to us,
the functions of the Master of the Offices, came the
"Illustrious" <i>Quæstor</i>, the head-rhetorician of the
State, the official whose business it was to put the
thoughts of the sovereign into fitting and eloquent
words, either when he was replying to the ambassadors
of foreign powers, or when he was issuing laws
and proclamations to his own subjects. As his duties
and qualifications were of a more personal kind than
those of his two brother-ministers already described,
he had not like them a large official staff waiting
upon his orders.</p>

<p>There were two great financial ministers, <i>the Count
of Sacred Largesses</i> ("sacred", of course, is equivalent
to "Imperial"), and the <i>Count of Private Domains</i>,
whose duties practically related in the former
case to the personal, in the latter to the real, estate of
<a name="p152" id="p152"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 152</span>
the sovereign. Or perhaps, for it is difficult exactly to
define the nature of their various duties, it would be
better to think of the Count of Sacred Largesses as
the Imperial Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the
Count of Private Domains as the Chief Commissioner
of Woods and Forests.</p>

<p>The <i>Superintendent of the Sacred Dormitory</i> was
the Grand Chamberlain of the Empire, and commanding,
as he did, the army of pages, grooms of
the bed-chamber, vestiaries, and life-guardsmen, who
ministered to the myriad wants of an Arcadius or a
Honorius, he was not the least important among the
chief officers of the State.</p>

<p>These great civil ministers, eight in number under
the Western Emperors (for there were three Prætorian
Prefects, one for the Gauls, one for Italy, and
one for the City of Rome), formed, with the military
officers of highest rank (generally five in number),
the innermost circle of "Illustres", who may be
likened to the Cabinet of the Emperor. At this
time the Cabinet of Illustres may have been smaller
by one or two members, on account of the separation
of the Gaulish provinces from Rome, but we are not
able to speak positively on this point.</p>

<p>Nearly every one of these great ministers of state
had under him a large, ambitious, and often highly-paid
staff of subordinates, who were called his <i>Officium.</i>
The civil service was at least as regular and
highly specialised a profession under the Emperors
and under Theodoric as it is in any modern State.
It is possible that we should have to go to the Celestial
Empire of China to find its fitting representative.</p>

<a name="p153" id="p153"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 153</span>

<p>A large number of <i>singularii, rationalii, clavicularii,</i>
and the like (whom we should call policemen, subordinate
clerks, and gaolers) formed the "Unlettered
Staff" <i>(Militia Illiterata),</i> who stood on the lowest
stage of the bureaucratic pyramid. Above these was
the lettered staff, beginning with the humble chancellor
<i>(Cancellarius),</i> who sat by the <i>cancelli</i> (latticework),
at the bottom of the Court (to prevent importunate
suitors from venturing too far), and rising
to the dignified <i>Princeps or Cornicularius,</i> who was
looked upon as equal in rank to a Count, and who
expected to make an income of not less than £600
a year, equivalent to two or three times that amount
in our day.</p>

<p>All this great hierarchy of officials wielded powers
derived, mediately or immediately, from the Emperor
(or in the Ostrogothic monarchy from the
King), and great as was their brilliancy in the eyes
of the dazzled multitudes who crouched before
them, it was all reflected from him, who was the
central sun of their universe. But there were still
two institutions which were in theory independent
of Emperor or King, which were yet held venerable
by men, and which had come down from the days
of the great world-conquering republic, or the yet
earlier days of Romulus and Numa. These two
institutions were the Consulship and the Senate.</p>

<p>The <i>Consuls,</i> as was said in an earlier chapter, still
appeared to preside over the Roman Republic, as
they had in truth presided, wielding between them
the full power of a king, when Brutus and Collatinus,
a thousand years before Theodoric's commencement
<a name="p154" id="p154"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 154</span>
of the siege of Ravenna, took their seat upon the
curule chairs, and donned the <i>trabea</i> of the Consul.
Still, though utterly shorn of its power, the glamour
of the venerable office remained. The Emperor
himself seemed to add to his dignity when he
allowed himself to be nominated as Consul, and in
nothing was the cupidity of the tyrant Emperors
and the moderation of the patriot Emperors better
displayed than in the number of Consulships which
they claimed or forbore from claiming. Ever since
the virtual division of the Empire into an Eastern
and Western portion, it had been usual, though not
absolutely obligatory, for one Consul to be chosen
out of each half of the <i>Orbis Romanus,</i> and in reading
the contemporary chronicles we can almost invariably
tell to which portion the author belongs by
observing to which Consul's name he gives the
priority. As has been already stated, after the
resumption of friendly relations between Ravenna
and Constantinople, Theodoric, while naming the
Western Consul, sent a courteous notification of the
fact to the Emperor, by whom his nomination seems
to have been always accepted without question.
The great Ostrogoth, having once worn the Consular
robes and distributed largess to "the Roman
People" in the streets of Constantinople, does not
seem to have cared a second time to assume that
ancient dignity, but in the year 519, towards the
end of his reign, he named his son-in-law, Eutharic,
Consul, and the splendour of Eutharic's year of office
was enhanced by the fact that he had the then
reigning Emperor, Justin, for his colleague.
<a name="p155" id="p155"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 155</span>
As for the <i>Senate,</i> it too was still in appearance
what it had ever been,--the highest Council in the
State, the assembly of kings which overawed the
ambassador of Pyrrhus, the main-spring, or, if not
the main-spring, at any rate the balance-wheel, of
the administrative machine. This it was in theory,
for there had never been any formal abolition of its
existence or abrogation of its powers. In practice it
was just what the sovereign, whether called Emperor
or King, allowed it to be. A self-willed and arbitrary
monarch, like Caligula or Domitian, would reduce its
functions to a nullity. A wise and moderate Emperor,
like Trajan or Marcus Aurelius, would consult it
on all important state-affairs, and, while reserving to
himself both the power of initiation and that of final
control, would make of it a real Council of State, a
valuable member of the governing body of the
Empire. The latter seems to have been the policy
of Theodoric. Probably the very fact of his holding
a somewhat doubtful position towards the Emperor
at Constantinople made him more willing to accept
all the moral support that could be given him by
the body which was in a certain sense older and
more august than any Emperor, the venerable Senate
of Rome. At any rate, the letters in which he announces
to the Senate the various acts, especially the
nomination of the great officials of his kingdom,
in which he desires their concurrence, are couched in
such extremely courteous terms, that sometimes civility
almost borders on servility. Notwithstanding this,
however, it is quite plain that it was always thoroughly
understood who was master in Italy, and
<a name="p156" id="p156"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 156</span>
that any attempt on the part of the Senate to wrest
any portion of real power from Theodoric would
have been instantly and summarily suppressed.</p>

<p>I have said that it was only by the aid of officials,
trained in the service of the Empire that Theodoric,
or indeed any of the new barbarian sovereigns, could
hope to keep the machine of civil government in
working order. We have, fortunately, a little information
as to some of these officials, and an
elaborate self-drawn picture of one of them.</p>

<p><i>Liberius</i> had been a faithful servant of Odovacar;
and had to the last remained by the sinking vessel of
his fortunes. This fidelity did not injure him in the
estimation of the conqueror. When all was over, he
came, with no eagerness, and with unconcealed sorrow
for the death of his former master, to offer his
services to Theodoric, who gladly accepted them,
and gave him at once the pre-eminent dignity of
Prætorian Prefect. His wise and economical management
of the finances filled the royal exchequer
without increasing the burdens of the tax-payer,
and it is probable that the early return of prosperity
to Italy, which was described in the last chapter,
was, in great measure, due to the just and statesmanlike
administration of Liberius. In the delicate
business of allotting to the Gothic warriors the third
part of the soil of Italy, which seems to have been
their recognised dividend on Theodoric's Italian
speculation, he so acquitted himself as to win the
approbation of all. It is difficult for us to understand
how such a change of ownership can have
brought with it anything but heart-burning and resentment.
<a name="p157" id="p157"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 157</span>
But (1) there are not wanting indications
that, owing to evil influences both economic and
political, there was actually a large quantity of good
land lying unoccupied in Italy in the fifth century;
and (2) there had already been one expropriation of
the same kind for the benefit of the soldiers of Odovacar.
In so far as this allotment of Thirds<a id="footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a>
<a href="#footnote83"><sup class="sml">83</sup></a> merely
followed the lines of that earlier redistribution, but
little of a grievance was caused to the Italian owner.
An Ostrogoth, the follower of Theodoric, stepped
into the position of a slain Scyrian or Turcilingian,
the follower of Odovacar, and the Italian owner
suffered no further detriment. Still there must have
been some loss to the provincials and some cases of
hardship which would be long and bitterly remembered,
before every family which crossed the Alps in
the Gothic waggons was safely settled in its Italian
home. It is therefore not without some qualification
that we can accept the statement of the official
panegyrist<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a>
<a href="#footnote84"><sup class="sml">84</sup></a> of the Gothic <i>regime</i>, who declares that
in this business of the allotment of the Thirds "Liberius
joined both the hearts and the properties of
the two nations, Gothic and Roman. For whereas
neighbourhood often proves a cause of enmity, with
these men communion of farms proved a cause of
concord.<a id="footnotetag85" name="footnotetag85"></a>
<a href="#footnote85"><sup class="sml">85</sup></a> Thus the division of the soil promoted
the concord of the owners; friendship grew out of
<a name="p158" id="p158"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 158</span>
the loss of the provincials, and the land gained a
defender, whose possession of part guaranteed the
quiet enjoyment of the remainder". It is possible
that there was some foundation of truth for the last
statement. After the fearful convulsions through
which the whole Western Empire had passed, and
with the strange paralysis of the power of self-defence
which had overtaken the once brave and hardy
population of Italy, it is possible that the presence,
near to each considerable Italian landowner, of a
Goth whose duty to his king obliged him to defend
the land from foreign invasion, and to suppress with
a strong hand all robbery and brigandage, may have
been felt in some cases as a compensation even for
whatever share of the soil of Italy was transferred
to Goth from Roman by the Chief Commissioner,
Liberius.</p>

<p>Two eminent Romans, whom in the early years of
his reign Theodoric placed in high offices of state,
were the two successive ambassadors to Constantinople,
<i>Faustus</i> and <i>Festus</i>. Both seem to have
held the high dignity of Prætorian Prefect. We
do not, however, hear much as to the career
of Festus, and what we hear of Faustus is not
altogether to his credit. He had been for several
years practically the Prime Minister of Theodoric,
when in an evil hour for his reputation he coveted
the estate of a certain Castorius, whose land adjoined
his own. Deprived of his patrimony, Castorius
appealed, not in vain, to the justice of Theodoric,
whose ears were not closed, as an Emperor's would
probably have been, to the cry of a private citizen
<a name="p159" id="p159"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 159</span>
against a powerful official. "We are determined",
says Theodoric, in his reply to the petition of Castorius,
"to assist the humble and to repress the
violence of the proud. If the petition of Castorius
prove to be well-founded, let the spoiler restore to
Castorius his property and hand over besides another
estate of equal value. If the Magnificent
Faustus have employed any subordinate in this
act of injustice, bring him to us bound with chains
that he may pay for the outrage in person, if he
cannot do so in purse. If on any future occasion
that now known craftsman of evil (Faustus) shall
attempt to injure the aforesaid Castorius, let him be
at once fined fifty pounds of gold (£2,000). Greatest
of all punishments will be the necessity of beholding
the untroubled estate of the man whom he sought
to ruin. Behold herein a deed which may well
chasten and subdue the hearts of all our great dignitaries
when they see that not even a Prætorian Prefect
is permitted to trample on the lowly, and that
when we put forth our arm to help, such an one's
power of injuring the wretched fails him. From
this may all men learn how great is our love of justice,
since we are willing to diminish even the power
of our judges, that we may increase the contentment
of our own conscience". This edict was followed by
a letter to the Illustrious Faustus himself, in which
that grasping governor was reminded that human
nature frequently requires a change, and permission
was graciously given him to withdraw for four months
into the country. At the end of that time he was
without fail to return to the capital, since no Roman
<a name="p160" id="p160"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 160</span>
Senator ought to be happy if permanently settled
anywhere but at Rome. It is tolerably plain that
the four months' <i>villeggiatura</i> was really a sentence
of temporary banishment, and we may probably conclude
that the Magnificent Faustus never afterwards
held any high position under Theodoric.</p>

<p>The letters announcing the King's judgment in this
matter, like all the other extant state-papers of Theodoric,
were written by a man who was probably
by the fall of Faustus raised a step in the official
hierarchy, and who was certainly for the last twenty
years of the reign of Theodoric one of the most conspicuous
of his Roman officials. This was Cassiodorus,
or, to give him his full name, <i>Magnus Aurelius
Cassiodorus Senator</i>, a man, whose life and character
require to be described in some detail.</p>

<p>Cassiodorus was sprung from a noble Roman
family, which had already given three of its members
in lineal succession (all bearing the name
Cassiodorus) to the service of the State. His great-grandfather,
of "Illustrious" rank, defended Sicily
and Calabria from the incursions of the Vandals.
His grandsire, a Tribune in the army, was sent
by the Emperor Valentinian III. on an important
embassy to Attila. His father filled first one and
then the other of the two highest financial offices in
the State under Odovacar. On the overthrow of
that chieftain, he, like Liberius, transferred his
services to Theodoric, who employed him as governor
first of Sicily, then of Calabria, and finally,
about the year 500, conferred upon him the highest
dignity of all, that of Prætorian Prefect.</p>

<a name="p161" id="p161"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 161</span>
<p>The ancestral possessions of the Cassiodori were
situated m that southernmost province, sometimes
likened to the toe of Italy, which was then called
Bruttii, and is now called Calabria. It was a land
rich in cattle, renowned for its cheese and for its
aromatic, white Palmatian wine; and veins of gold
were said to be in its mountains. Here, in the old
Greek city of Scyllacium <i>(Sguillace)</i>, "a city perched
upon a high hill overlooking the sea, sunny yet
fanned by cool Mediterranean breezes, and looking
peacefully on the cornfields, the vineyards, and the
olive-groves around her",<a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a>
<a href="#footnote86"><sup class="sml">86</sup></a> Cassiodorus was born,
about the year 480. He was therefore probably
some twelve or thirteen years of age when the long
strife between Odovacar and Theodoric was ended
by the murder scene in the palace at Ravenna.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote86"
name="footnote86"></a><b>Footnote 86:</b><a href="#footnotetag86">
(return) </a> The description is taken from Cassiodorus, Var., xii., i5.</blockquote>

<p>Like all the young Roman nobles who aspired
to the honours and emoluments of public life, Cassiodorus
studied philosophy and rhetoric, and, according
to the standard of the age, a degraded
standard, he acquired great proficiency in both lines
of study. When his father was made Prætorian
Prefect (about the year 500), the young rhetorician
received an appointment as <i>Consiliarius</i>, or Assessor
in the Prefect's court, at a salary which probably
did not exceed forty or fifty pounds. While he was
holding this position, it fell to his lot to pronounce
a laudatory oration on Theodoric (perhaps on the
occasion of one of his visits to Rome), and the
eloquence of the young <i>Consiliarius</i> so delighted the
King, that he was at once made an "Illustrious"
<a name="p162" id="p162"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 162</span>
Quæstor, thus receiving what we should call cabinet-rank
while he was still considerably under thirty
years of age. The Quæstor, as has been said, was
the Public Orator of the State. It devolved upon
him to reply to the formal harangues in which the
ambassadors of foreign nations greeted his master,
to answer the petitions of his subjects, and to see
that the edicts of the sovereign were expressed in
proper terms. The post exactly fitted the intellectual
tendencies of Cassiodorus, who was never so
happy as when he was wrapping up some commonplace
thought in a garment of sonorous but turgid
rhetoric; and the simple honesty of his moral nature,
simple in its very vanity and honest in its childlike
egotism, coupled as it was with real love for his
country and loyal zeal for her welfare, endeared him
in his turn to Theodoric, with whom he had many
"<i>gloriosa colloquia</i>" (as he calls them), conversations
in which the young, learned, and eloquent Roman
poured forth for his master the stored up wine of
generations of philosophers and poets, while the
kingly barbarian doubtless unfolded some of the
propositions of that more difficult science, the
knowledge of men, which he had acquired by long
and arduous years of study in the council-chamber,
on the mountain-march, and on the battle-field.</p>

<p>We can go at once to the fountain-head for
information as to the character of Cassiodorus.
When he was promoted, soon after the death of
Theodoric, to the rank of Prætorian Prefect, it
became his duty, as Quæstor to the young King
Athalaric (Theodoric's successor), to inform himself
<a name="p163" id="p163"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 163</span>
by an official letter of the honour conferred upon
him. In writing this letter, he does not deviate
from the usual custom of describing the virtues and
accomplishments which justify the new minister's
promotion. Why indeed should he keep silence on
such an occasion? No one could know the good
qualities of Cassiodorus so well or so intimately
as Cassiodorus himself, and accordingly the Quæstor
sets forth, with all the rhetoric of which he had
such an endless supply, the virtues and the accomplishments
which his observant eye has discovered
in himself, the new Prætorian Prefect. Such a
course would certainly not be often pursued by a
modern statesman, but there is a pleasing ingenuousness
about it which to some minds will be more
attractive than our present methods, the "inspired"
article in a hired newspaper, or the feigned reluctance
to receive a testimonial which, till the receiver
suggested it, no one had dreamed of offering.</p>

<p>This then is how Cassiodorus, in 533, describes his
past career<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a>
<a href="#footnote87"><sup class="sml">87</sup></a>: "You came (his young sovereign, Athalaric,
is supposed to be addressing him) in
very early years to the dignity of Quæstor;
and mv grandfather's (Theodoric's) wonderful insight
into character was never more abundantly proved
than in your case, for he found you to be endued with
rare conscientiousness, and already ripe in your
knowledge of the laws. You were in truth the
chief glory of your times, and you won his favour
by arts which none could blame, for his mind, by
nature anxious in all things, was able to lay aside its
<a name="p164" id="p164"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 164</span>
cares while you supported the weight of the royal
counsels with the strength of your eloquence. In
you he had a charming secretary, a rigidly upright
judge, a minister to whom avarice was unknown.
You never fixed a scandalous tariff for the sale of his
benefits; you chose to take your reward in public
esteem, not in riches. Therefore it was that this
most righteous ruler chose you to be honoured by
his glorious friendship, because he saw you to be
free from all taint of corrupt vices. How often did
he fix your place among his white-haired counsellors;
inasmuch as they, by the experience of years, had
not come up to the point from which you had
started! He found that he could safely praise your
excellent disposition, open-handed in bestowing benefits,
tightly closed against the vices of avarice.</p>

the Offices,<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a>
<a href="#footnote88"><sup class="sml">88</sup></a> which you obtained, not by a pecuniary
payment, but as a testimony to your character. In
that office you were ever ready to help the Quæstors,
for when pure eloquence was needed men
always resorted to you; and, in fact, when you were

division of labour among the various offices of the

<p>Your detractors were conquered by the integrity of
your life; your adversaries, bowing to public opinion,
were obliged to praise even while they hated
you.</p>

<p>"To the lord of the land you showed yourself a
friendly judge and an intimate minister. When
public affairs no longer claimed him, he would ask
you to tell him the stories in which wise men of old
have clothed their maxims, that by his own deeds
he might equal the ancient heroes. The courses of
the stars, the ebb and flow of the sea, the marvels
of springing fountains,--nto all these subjects would
that most acute questioner inquire, so that by his
diligent investigations into the nature of things, he
seemed to be a philosopher in the purple".</p>

<p>This sketch of the character of the minister throws
light incidentally on that of the monarch who employed
him. Of course, as a general rule, history
cannot allow the personages with whom she deals to
write their own testimonials, but in this case there is
reason to think that the self-portraiture of Cassiodorus
is accurate in its main outlines, though our
modern taste would have suggested the employment
of somewhat less florid colouring.</p>

<p>One literary service which Cassiodorus rendered
to the Ostrogothic monarchy is thus described by
himself, still speaking in his young king's name and
addressing the Roman Senate.<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a>
<a href="#footnote90"><sup class="sml">90</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote90"

<p>"He was not satisfied with extolling surviving
Kings, from whom their panegyrist might hope for a
reward. He extended his labours to our remote
<a name="p166" id="p166"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 166</span>
ancestry, learning from books that which the hoary
memories of our old men scarcely retained. He
drew forth from their hiding-place the Kings of the
Goths, hidden by long forgetfulness. He restored
the Amals in all the lustre of their lineage, evidently
proving that we have Kings for our ancestors up to
the seventeenth generation. He made the origin of
the Goths part of Roman history, collecting into one
wreath the flowers which had previously been scattered
over the wide plains of literature. Consider,
therefore, what love he showed to you (the Senate)
in uttering our praises, while teaching that the
nation of your sovereign has been from ancient time
a marvellous people: so that you who from the days
of your ancestors have been truly deemed noble are
also now ruled over by the long-descended progeny
of Kings".</p>

<p>These sentences relate to the "Gothic History"
of Cassiodorus, which once existed in twelve books,
but is now unfortunately lost. A hasty abridgment
of it, made by an ignorant monk named Jordanes, is
all that now remains. Even this, with its many faults,
is a most precious monument of the early history of
the Teutonic invaders of the Empire, and it is from
its pages that much of the information contained in
the previous chapters is drawn. The object of the
original statesman-author in composing his "Gothic
History" is plainly stated in the above sentences.
He wishes to heal the wound given to Roman pride
by the fact of the supremacy in Italy of a Gothic
lord; and in order to effect this object he strings
together all that he can collect of the Sagas of the
<a name="p167" id="p167"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 167</span>
Gothic people, showing the great deeds of the Amal
progenitors of Theodoric, whose lineage he traces
back into distant centuries. "It is true" he seems
to say to the Senators of Rome, "that you, who
once ruled the world, are now ruled by an alien; but
at least that alien is no new-comer into greatness.
He and his progenitors have been crowned Kings for
centuries. His people, who are quartered among
you and claim one-third of the soil of Italy, are an
old, historic people. Their ancestors fought under
the walls of Troy; they defeated Cyrus, King of
Persia; they warred not ingloriously with Perdiccas
of Macedonia".</p>

<p>These classical elements of the Gothic history of
Cassiodorus (which rest chiefly on a misunderstanding
of the vague and unscientific term "Scythians")
are valueless for the purposes of history; but the old
Gothic Sagas, of which he has evidently also preserved
some fragments, are both interesting and valuable.
When a nation has played so important a part on the
theatre of the world as that assigned to the Goths,
even their legendary stories of the past are precious.
Whether these early Amal Kings fought and ruled
and migrated as the Sagas represent them to have
done, or not, in any case the belief that these were
their achievements was a part of the intellectual
heritage of the Gothic peoples. The songs to whose
lullaby the cradle of a great nation is rocked are a
precious possession to the historian.</p>

<p>The other most important work of Cassiodorus is
the collection of letters called the <i>Variæ,</i> in twelve
books. This collection contains all the chief state-papers
<a name="p168" id="p168"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 168</span>
composed by him during the period (somewhat
more than thirty years) which was covered by
his official life. Five books are devoted to the letters
written at the dictation of Theodoric; two to
the <i>Formulæ</i> or model-letters addressed to the various
dignitaries of the State on their accession to office;
three to the letters written in the name of Theodoric's
immediate successors (his grandson, daughter,
and nephew); and two to those written by Cassiodorus
himself in his own name when he had attained
the crowning dignity of Prætorian Prefect.</p>

<p>I have already made some extracts from this collection
of "Various Epistles" and the reader, from
the specimens thus submitted to him, will have
formed some conception of the character of the
author's style. That style is diffuse and turgid,
marked in an eminent degree with the prevailing
faults of the sixth century, an age of literary decay,
when the language of Cicero and Virgil was falling
into its dotage. There is much ill-timed display of
irrelevant learning, and a grievous absence of simplicity
and directness, in the "Various Epistles". It
must be regarded as a misfortune for Theodoric that
his maxims of statesmanship, which were assuredly
full of manly sense and vigour, should have reached
us only in such a shape, diluted with the platitudes
and false rhetoric of a scholar of the decadence.
Still, even through all these disguises, it is easy to
discern the genuine patriotism both of the great
King and of his minister, their earnest desire that
right, not might, should determine every case that
came before them, their true insight into the vices
<a name="p169" id="p169"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 169</span>
and the virtues of each of the two different nations
which now shared Italy between them, their persevering
endeavour to keep <i>civilitas</i> intact, their determination
to oppose alike the turbulence of the
Goth and the chicane of the scheming Roman.</p>

<p>As specimens of the rhetoric of Cassiodorus when
he is trying his highest flights, the reader may care to
peruse the two following letters. The first<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a>
<a href="#footnote91"><sup class="sml">91</sup></a>  was written to Faustus the Prætorian Prefect, to complain
of his delay in forwarding some cargoes of
corn from Calabria to Rome:</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote91"
name="footnote91"></a><b>Footnote 91:</b><a href="#footnotetag91">
(return) </a> Var., i., 35.</blockquote>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" says Cassiodorus,
writing in his master's name. "Why are your ships
not spreading their sails to the breeze? When the
South-wind is blowing and your oarsmen are urging
on your vessels, has the sucking-fish (Echeneis) fastened its bite upon them through the liquid waves? Or
have the shell-fishes of the Indian Sea with similar
power stayed your keels with their lips: those creatures
whose quiet touch is said to hold back, more
than the tumultuous elements can possibly urge forward?
The idle bark stands still, though winged
with swelling sails, and has no way on her though
the breeze is propitious; she is fixed without anchors; she is moored without cables, and these tiny
animals pull back, more than all such favouring
powers can propel. Therefore when the subject
wave would hasten the vessel's course, it appears
that it stands fixed on the surface of the sea: and in
marvellous style the floating ship is retained immovable,
<a name="p170" id="p170"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 170</span>
while the wave is hurried along by countless
currents.</p>

<p>"But let us describe the nature of another kind of
fish. Perhaps the crews of the aforesaid ships have
been benumbed into idleness by the touch of a torpedo,
by which the right hand of him who attacks it
is so deadened--even through the spear by which it is
itself wounded--that while still part of a living body
it hangs down benumbed without sense or motion.
I think some such misfortunes must have happened
to men who are unable to move themselves.</p>

<p>"But no. The sucking-fish of these men is their
hindering corruption. The shell-fishes that bite them
are their avaricious hearts. The torpedo that benumbs
them is lying guile. With perverted ingenuity
they manufacture delays, that they may seem
to have met with a run of ill-luck.</p>

<p>"Let your Greatness, whom it especially behoves
to take thought for such matters, cause that this
be put right by speediest rebuke: lest the famine,
which will otherwise ensue, be deemed to be the
child of negligence rather than of the barrenness of
the land".</p>

<p>The occasion of the second letter (Var., x., 30.) was as follows.
Some brazen images of elephants which adorned the
Sacred Street of Rome were falling into ruin, Cassiodorus,
writing in the name of one of Theodoric's
successors, to the Prefect of the City, orders that
their gaping limbs should be strengthened by hooks,
and their pendulous bellies should be supported by
masonry. He then proceeds to give to the admiring
<a name="p171" id="p171"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 171</span>
Prefect some wonderful information as to the natural
history of the elephant. He regrets that the metal
effigies should be so soon destroyed, when the animal
which they represent is accustomed to live more than
a thousand years.</p>

<p>"The living elephant" he says, "when it is once
prostrate on the ground, cannot rise unaided, because
it has no joints in its feet. Hence when they
are helping men to fell timber, you see numbers of
them lying on the earth till men come and help
them to rise. Thus this creature, so formidable
by its size, is really more helpless than the tiny
ant. The elephant, wiser than all other creatures,
renders religious adoration to the Ruler of all:
also to good princes, but if a tyrant approach, it will
not pay him the homage which is due only to the
virtuous. It uses its proboscis, that nose-like hand
which Nature has given it in compensation for its
very short neck, for the benefit of its master, accepting
the presents which will be profitable to him. It
always walks cautiously, remembering that fatal fall
into the hunter's pit which was the beginning of its
captivity. When requested to do so, it exhales its
breath, which is said to be a remedy for the headache.</p>

<p>"When it comes to water, it sucks up a vast quantity
in its trunk, and then at the word of command
squirts it forth like a shower. If any one have
treated its demands with contempt, it pours forth
such a stream of dirty water over him that one
would think that a river had entered his house. For
this beast has a wonderfully long memory, both of
<a name="p172" id="p172"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 172</span>
injury and of kindness. Its eyes are small but move
solemnly, so that there is a sort of royal majesty in
its appearance: and it despises scurrile jests, while it
always looks with pleasure on that which is honourable".</p>

<p>It must be admitted that if the official communications
of modern statesmen thus anxiously combined
amusement with instruction, the dull routine
of "I have the honour to inform" and "I beg to
remain your obedient humble servant", would
acquire a charm of which it is now destitute.</p>

<p>I have translated two letters which show the ludicrous
side of the literary character of Cassiodorus.
In justice to this honest, if somewhat pedantic, servant
of Theodoric, I will close this sketch of his
character with a state-paper of a better type, and
one which incidentally throws some light on the
social condition of Italy under the Goths.</p>

<p>"THEODORIC to the Illustrious Neudes. (Var., v., 29.)</p>

<p>"We were moved to sympathy by the long petition
of Ocer but yet more by beholding the old hero,
bereft of the blessing of sight, inasmuch as the
calamities which we witness make more impression
upon us than those of which we only hear. He,
poor man, living on in perpetual darkness, had to
borrow the sight of another to hasten to our presence
in order that he might feel the sweetness of
our clemency, though he could not gaze upon our
countenance.</p>

<a name="p173" id="p173"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 173</span>

<p>"He complains that Gudila and Oppas (probably
two Gothic nobles or a Gothic chief and his wife)
have reduced him to a state of slavery, a condition
unknown to him or his fathers, since he once served
in our army as a free man. We marvel that such a
man should be dragged into bondage who (on account
of his infirmity) ought to have been liberated
by a lawful owner. It is a new kind of ostentation
to claim the services of such an one, the sight of
whom shocks you, and to call that man a slave, to
whom you ought rather to minister with divine
compassion.</p>

<p>"He adds also that all claims of this nature have
been already judged invalid after careful examination
by Count Pythias, a man celebrated for the correctness
of his judgments. But now overwhelmed by
the weight of his calamity, he cannot assert his freedom
by his own right hand, which in the strong man
is the most effectual advocate of his claims. We,
however, whose peculiar property it is to administer
justice indifferently, whether between men of equal
or unequal condition, do by this present mandate
decree, that if, in the judgment of the aforesaid
Pythias, Ocer have proved himself free-born, you
shall at once remove those who are harassing him
with their claims, nor shall they dare any longer to
mock at the calamities of others: these people who
once convicted ought to have been covered with
shame for their wicked designs".</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h3>THE ARIAN LEAGUE.</h3>

<p>Political bearings of the Arianism of the German invaders of the
Empire--Vandals, Suevi, Visigoths, Burgundians--Uprise of
the power of Clovis--His conversion to Christianity--His wars
with Gundobad, king of the Burgundians--With Alaric II.,
king of the Visigoths--Downfall of the monarchy of Toulouse--Usurpation
of Gesalic--Theodoric governs Spain as guardian of
his grandson Amalaric.</p>

<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/018.png">he position of Theodoric in relation
both to his own subjects and
to the Empire was seriously modified
by one fact to which hitherto
I have only alluded casually, the
fact that he, like the great majority
of the Teutonic invaders of the
Empire, was an adherent of the
Arian form of Christianity. In
order to estimate at its true value the bearing of
religion, or at least of religious profession, on politics,
at the time of the fall of the Roman State, we might
well look at the condition of another dominion,
<a name="p176" id="p176"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 176</span>
founded under the combined influence of martial
spirit and religious zeal, which is now going to pieces
under our very eyes, I mean the Empire of the
Ottomans. In the lands which are still under the
sway of the Sultan, religion may not be a great
spiritual force, but it is at any rate a great political
lever. When you have said that a man is a Moslem
or a Druse, a member of the Orthodox or of the
Catholic Church, an Armenian or a Protestant, you
have almost always said enough to define his political
position. Without the need of additional information
you have already got the elements of his
civic equation, and can say whether he is a loyal
subject of the Porte, or whether he looks to Russia
or Greece, to France, Austria, or England as the
sovereign of his future choice. In fact, as has been
often pointed out, in the East at this day "Religion
is Nationality".</p>

<p>Very similar to this was the condition of the ancient
world at the time when the general movement
of the Northern nations began. The battle with
heathenism was virtually over, Christianity being the
unquestioned conqueror; but the question, which
of the many modifications of Christianity devised by
the subtle Hellenic and Oriental intellects should be
the victor, was a question still unsettled, and debated
with the keenest interest on all the shores of the
Mediterranean. So keen indeed was the interest
that it sometimes seems almost to have blinded the
disputants to the fact that the Roman Empire, the
greatest political work that the world has ever seen,
was falling in ruins around them. When we want
<a name="p177" id="p177"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 177</span>
information about the march of armies and the fall
of States, the chroniclers to whom we turn for guidance,
withholding that which we seek, deluge us
with trivial talk about the squabbles of monks and
bishops, about Timothy the Weasel and Peter the
Fuller, and a host of other self-seeking ecclesiastics,
to whose names, to whose characters, and to whose
often violent deaths we are profoundly and absolutely
indifferent. But though a feeling of utter
weariness comes over the mind of most readers,
while watching the theological sword-play of the
fourth and fifth centuries, the historical student cannot
afford to shut his eyes altogether to the battle
of the creeds, which produced results of such infinite
importance to the crystallising process by which
Mediæval Europe was formed out of the Roman
Empire.</p>

<p>As I have just said, Theodoric the Ostrogoth,
like almost all the great Teutonic swarm-leaders,
like Alaric the Visigoth, like Gaiseric the Vandal,
like Gundobad the Burgundian, was an Arian.
On the other hand, the Emperors, Zeno, for instance,
and Anastasius, and the great majority of
the population of Italy and of the provinces of
the Empire, were Catholic. What was the amount
of theological divergence which was conveyed by
these terms Arian and Catholic, or to speak more
judicially (for the Arians averred that they were the
true Catholics and that their opponents were heretics)
Arian and Athanasian? As this is not the
place for a disquisition on disputed points of theology,
it is sufficient to say that, while the Athanasian
<a name="p178" id="p178"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 178</span>
held for truth the whole of the Nicene Creed, the
Arian--at least that type of Arian with whom we are
here concerned--would, in that part which relates to
the Son of God, leave out the words "being of one
substance with the Father", and would substitute
for them "being like unto the Father in such manner
as the Scriptures declare". He would also have
refused to repeat the words which assert the Godhead
of the Holy Spirit. These were important
differences, but it will be seen at once that they were
not so broad as those which now generally separate
"orthodox" from "heterodox" theologians.</p>

<p>The reasons which led the barbarian invaders of
the Empire to accept the Arian form of Christianity
are not yet fully disclosed to us. The cause could
not be an uncultured people's preference for a simple
faith, for the Arian champions were at least as subtle
and technical in their theology as the Athanasian,
and often surpassed them in these qualities. It is
possible that some remembrances of the mythology
handed down to them by their fathers made them
willing to accept a subordinate Christ, a spiritualised
"Balder the Beautiful", divine yet subject to death,
standing as it were upon the steps of his father's
throne, rather than the dogma, too highly spiritualised
for their apprehension, of One God in Three
Persons. But probably the chief cause of the Arianism
of the German invaders was the fact that the
Empire itself was to a great extent Arian when they
were in friendly relations with it, and were accepting
both religion and civilisation at its hands, in the
middle years of the fourth century.</p>

<a name="p179" id="p179"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 179</span>

<p>The most powerful factor in this change, the man
who more than all others was responsible for the
conversion of the Germanic races to Christianity,
in its Arian form, was the Gothic Bishop, Ulfilas
(311-381), whose construction of an Alphabet and
translation of the Scriptures into the language of his
fellow-countrymen have secured for him imperishable
renown among all who are interested in the history
of human speech. Ulfilas, who has been well
termed "The Apostle of the Goths", seems to have
embraced Christianity as a young man when he was
dwelling in Constantinople as a hostage (thus in some
measure anticipating the part which one hundred and
thirty years later was to be played by Theodoric), and
having been ordained first Lector (Reader) and afterwards
(341) Bishop of Gothia, he spent the remaining
forty years of his life in missionary journeys
among his countrymen in Dacia, in collecting those
of his converts who fled from the persecution of their
still heathen rulers, and settling them as colonists in
Mœsia, and, most important of all, in his great work
of the translation of the Bible into Gothic. Of this
work, as is well known, some precious fragments still
remain; most precious of all, the glorious Silver
Manuscript of the Gospels <i>(Codex Argenteus),</i> which
is supposed to have been written in the sixth century,
and which, after many wanderings and an eventful
history, rests now in a Scandinavian land, in the Library
of the University of Upsala, It is well worth
while to make a pilgrimage to that friendly and hospitable
Swedish city, if for no other purpose than to
see the letters (traced in silver on parchment of rich
<a name="p180" id="p180"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 180</span>
purple dye) in which the skilful amanuensis laboriously
transcribed the sayings of Christ rendered by
Bishop Ulfilas into the language of Alaric. For that
<i>Codex Argenteus</i> is oldest of all extant monuments
of Teutonic speech, the first fruit of that mighty tree
which now spreads its branches over half the civilised
world.</p>

<p>With the theological bearings of the Arian controversy
we have no present concern; but it is impossible
not to notice the unfortunate political results of
the difference of creed between the German invaders
and the great majority of the inhabitants of the Empire.
The cultivators of the soil and the dwellers in
the cities had suffered much from the misgovernment
of their rulers during the last two centuries of
Imperial sway; they could, to some extent, appreciate
the nobler moral qualities of the barbarian
settlers--their manliness, their truthfulness, their
higher standard of chastity; nor is it idle to suppose
that if there had been perfect harmony of religious
faith between the new-comers and the old inhabitants
they might soon have settled down into vigorous
and well-ordered communities, such as Theodoric
and Cassiodorus longed to behold, combining
the Teutonic strength with the Roman reverence for
law. Religious discord made it impossible to realise
this ideal The orthodox clergy loathed and dreaded
the invaders "infected", as they said, "with the
Arian pravity". The barbarian kings, unaccustomed
to have their will opposed by men who never wielded
a broadsword, were masterful and high-handed in
their demand for absolute obedience, even when
<a name="p181" id="p181"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 181</span>
their commands related to the things of God rather
than to the things of Cæsar; and the Arian bishops
and priests who stood beside their thrones, and who
had sometimes long arrears of vengeance for past
insult or oppression to exact, often wrought up the
monarch's mind to a perfect frenzy of fanatical rage,
and goaded him to cruel deeds which made reconciliation
between the warring creeds hopelessly impossible.
In Africa, the Vandal kings set on foot a
persecution of their Catholic subjects which rivalled,
nay exceeded, the horrors of the persecution under
Diocletian. Churches were destroyed, bishops banished,
and their flocks forbidden to elect their successors:
nay, sometimes, in the fierce quest after
hidden treasure, eminent ecclesiastics were stretched
on the rack, their mouths were filled with noisome
dirt, or cords were twisted round their foreheads or
their shins. In Gaul, under the Visigothic King
Euric, the persecution was less savage, but it was
stubborn and severe. Here, too, the congregations
were forbidden to elect successors to their exiled
bishops; the paths to the churches were stopped
up with thorns and briers; cattle grazed on the
grass-grown altar steps, and the rain came through
the shattered roofs into the dismantled basilicas.</p>

<p>Thus all round the shores of the Mediterranean
there was strife and bitter heart-burning between
the Roman provincial and his Teutonic "guest", not
so much because one was or called himself a Roman,
while the other called himself Goth, Burgundian, or
Vandal, but because one was Athanasian and the
other Arian. With this strife of creeds Theodoric,
<a name="p182" id="p182"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 182</span>
for the greater part of his reign, refused to concern
himself. He remained an Arian, as his fathers had
been before him, but he protected the Catholic
Church in the privileges which she had acquired,
and he refused to exert his royal authority to either
threaten or allure men into adopting his creed. So
evenly for many years did he hold the balance between
the rival faiths, that it was reported of him
that he put to death a Catholic priest who apostatised
to Arianism in order to attain the royal favour; and though this story does not perhaps rest
on sufficient authority, there can be no doubt that
the general testimony of the marvelling Catholic subjects
of Theodoric would have coincided with that
already quoted (See page 128.) from the Bishop of Ravenna that "he attempted nothing against the Catholic faith".</p>

<p>Still, though determined not to govern in the interests
of a sect, it was impossible that Theodoric's
political relations should not be, to a certain extent,
modified by his religious affinities. Let us glance at
the position of the chief States with which a ruler of
Italy at the close of the fifth century necessarily came
in contact.</p>

<p>First of all we have <i>the Empire,</i> practically confined
at this time to "the Balkan peninsula" south of the
Danube, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, and presided
over by the elderly, politic, but unpopular Anastasius.
This State is Catholic, though, as we shall
hereafter see, not in hearty alliance with the Church
of Rome.</p>

<p>Westward from the Empire, along the southern
<a name="p183" id="p183"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 183</span>
shore of the Mediterranean, stretches the great kingdom
of the <i>Vandals,</i> with Carthage for its capital.
They have a powerful navy, but their kings, Gunthamund
(484-496) and Thrasamund (496-523), do not
seem to be disposed to renew the buccaneering expeditions
of their grandfather, the great Vandal Gaiseric.
They are decided Arians, and keep up a stern, steady
pressure on their Catholic subjects, who are spared,
however, the ruthless brutalities practised upon them
by the earlier Vandal kings. The relations of the
Vandals with the Ostrogothic kingdom seem to have
been of a friendly character during almost the whole
reign of Theodoric. Thrasamund, the fourth king
who reigned at Carthage, married Amalafrida, Theodoric's
sister, who brought with her, as dowry, possession
of the strong fortress of Lilybæum <i>(Marsala),</i> in
the west of Sicily, and who was accompanied to her
new home by a brilliant train of one thousand Gothic
nobles with five thousand mounted retainers.</p>

<p>In the north and west of Spain dwell the nation
of the <i>Suevi,</i> Teutonic and Arian, but practically out
of the sphere of European politics, and who, half a
century after the death of Theodoric, will be absorbed
by their Visigothic neighbours.</p>

<p>This latter state, the kingdom of the <i>Visigoths,</i> is
apparently, at the end of the fifth century, by far
the most powerful of the new barbarian monarchies.
All Spain, except its north-western corner, and something
like half of Gaul--namely, that region which
is contained between the Pyrenees and the Loire,
owns the sway of the young king, whose capital city
is Toulouse, and who, though a stranger in blood,
-<a name="p184" id="p184"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 184</span>
bears the name of the great Visigoth who first battered
a breach in the walls of Rome, the mighty Alaric.
This Alaric II. (485-507), the son of Euric, who had
been the most powerful sovereign of his dynasty, inherited
neither his father's force of character (485-507)
nor the bitterness of his Arianism. The persecution
of the Catholics was suspended, or
ceased altogether, and we may picture to ourselves
the congregations again wending their way by unblockaded
paths to the house of prayer, the churches
once more roofed in and again made gorgeous by the
stately ceremonial of the Catholic rite. In other ways,
too, Alaric showed himself anxious to conciliate the
favour of his Roman subjects. He ordered an abstract
of the Imperial Code to be prepared, and this abstract,
under the name of the <i>Breviarium Alaricianum</i><a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a>
<a href="#footnote92"><sup class="sml">92</sup></a> is to this day one of our most valuable sources of information as to Roman Law.
He is also said to have
directed the construction of the canal, which still
bears his name <i>(Canal d'Alaric),</i> and which, connecting
the Adour with the Aisne, assists the irrigation
of the meadows of Gascony. But all these attempts
to close the feud between the king and his orthodox
subjects were vain. When the day of trial came, it
was seen, as it had long been suspected, that the
sympathies and the powerful influence of the bishops
and clergy were thrown entirely on the side of the
Catholic invader.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote92"
name="footnote92"></a><b>Footnote 92:</b><a href="#footnotetag92">
(return) </a> Sometimes called the <i>Breviarium Aniani,</i> from the name of the Registrar whose signature attested each copy of the <i>Breviarium.</i></blockquote>

<p>Between the Visigothic and Ostrogothic courts
there was firm friendship and alliance, the remembrance
<a name="p185" id="p185"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 185</span>
of their common origin and of many perils
and hardships shared together on the shores of the
Euxine and in the passes of the Balkans being fortified
by the knowledge of the dangers to which their
common profession of Arianism exposed them amidst
the Catholic population of the Empire. The alliance,
which had served Theodoric in good stead when the
Visigoths helped him in his struggle with Odovacar,
was yet further strengthened by kinship, the young
king of Toulouse having received in marriage a princess
from Ravenna, whose name is variously given as
Arevagni or Ostrogotho.</p>

<p>A matrimonial alliance also connected Theodoric
with the king of the <i>Burgundians</i>. These invaders,
who were destined so strangely to disappear out of
history themselves, while giving their name to such
wide and rich regions of mediæval Europe, occupied
at this time the valleys of the Saone and the Rhone,
as well as the country which we now call Switzerland.
Their king, Gundobad, a man somewhat older
than Theodoric, had once interfered zealously in the
politics of Italy, making and unmaking Emperors
and striking for Odovacar against his Ostrogothic
rival. Now, however, his whole energies were directed
to extending his dominions in Gaul, and to
securing his somewhat precarious throne from the
machinations of the Catholic bishops, his subjects.
For he, too, was by profession an Arian, though of
a tolerant type, and though he sometimes seemed
on the point of crossing the abyss and declaring
himself a convert to the Nicene faith. Theudegotho,
sister of Arevagni, was given by her father, Theodoric
<a name="p186" id="p186"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 187</span>
in marriage to Sigismund, the son and heir of Gundobad.</p>

<p>The event which intensified the fears of all these
Arian kings, and which left to each one little more
than the hope that he might be the last to be devoured,
was the conversion to Catholicism of Clovis,<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a>
<a href="#footnote93"><sup class="sml">93</sup></a>
the heathen king of the <i>Franks</i>, that fortunate barbarian
who, by a well-timed baptism, won for his
tribe of rude warriors the possession of the fairest
land in Europe and the glory of giving birth to one
of the foremost nations in the world.

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote93"
name="footnote93"></a><b>Footnote 93:</b><a href="#footnotetag93">

I call the Frankish king by the name by which he is best known
in history, though no doubt the more correct form is either Hlodwig
or Chlodovech. It is of course the same name with Ludovicus or
Louis I do not know whether the barbarian sound of Hlodwig
offended the delicate taste of Cassiodorus, but in the "Various Letters" he addresses the king of the Franks as Ludum. It seems
probable that there was some harsh guttural before the L which
Gregory of Tours endeavoured to represent by Ch (Chlodovech),
while Cassiodorus, receiving the name from the Frankish barbarians,
thought it safer to leave it unrepresented (Ludum). In any case his
<i>n</i> must have been due to some defective understanding of the final sound.</blockquote>

<p>As we are here come to one of the common-places
of history, I need but very briefly remind the reader
of the chief stages in the upward course of the
young Frankish king. Born in 466, he succeeded
his father, Childeric, as one of the kings of the Salian
Franks in 481. The lands of the Salians occupied
but the extreme northern corner of modern France,
and a portion of Flanders, and even here Clovis
was but one of many kinglets allied by blood but
frequently engaged in petty and inglorious wars one
with another.</p>

<a name="p187" id="p187"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 187</span>

<p>For five years the young Salian chieftain lived in
peace with his neighbours. In the twentieth year of
his age (486) he sprang with one bound into fame and
dominion by attacking and overcoming the Roman
Syagrius, who with ill-defined prerogatives, and bearing
the title not of Emperor or of Prefect, but of
King, had succeeded amidst the wreck of the
Western Empire in preserving some of the
fairest districts of the north of Gaul from barbarian
domination. With the help of some of his brother
chiefs, Clovis overthrew this "King of Soissons".
Syagrius took refuge at the court of Toulouse, and
the Frankish king now felt himself strong enough to
send to the young Alaric, who had ascended the
throne only a year before, a peremptory message,
insisting, under the penalty of a declaration of war,
on the surrender of the Roman fugitive. The Visigoth
was mean-spirited enough to purchase peace
by delivering up his guest, bound in fetters, to the
ambassadors of Clovis, who shortly after ordered
him to be privily done to death. From that time,
we may well believe, Clovis felt confident that he
should one day vanquish Alaric.</p>

<p>About seven years after this event (493) came his
memorable marriage with Clotilda,<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a>
<a href="#footnote94"><sup class="sml">94</sup></a> a Burgundian
princess, who, unlike her Arian uncle, Gundobad,
was enthusiastically devoted to the Catholic faith,
and who ceased not by private conversations and
by inducing him to listen to the sermons of the eloquent
Bishop Remigius, to endeavour to win her
husband from the religion of his heathen forefathers
<a name="p188" id="p188"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 188</span>
to the creed of Rome and of the Empire. Clovis,
however, for some years wavered. Sprung himself,
according to the traditions of his people, from the
sea-god Meroveus, he was not in haste to renounce
this fabulous glory, nor to acknowledge as Lord, One
who had been reared in a carpenter's shop at Nazareth.
He allowed Clotilda to have her eldest son
baptised, but when the child soon after died, he
took that as a sign of the power and vengeance of
the old gods. A second son was born, was baptised,
fell sick. Had that child died, Clovis would probably
have remained an obstinate heathen, but the
little one recovered, given back, as was believed, to
the earnest prayers of his mother.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote94"
name="footnote94"></a><b>Footnote 94:</b><a href="#footnotetag94">
(return) </a> More accurately Chrotchildis.</blockquote>

<p>It was perhaps during these years of indecision as
to his future religious profession, that Clovis consented
to a matrimonial alliance between his house
and that of the Arian Theodoric. The great Ostrogoth
married, probably about the year 495, the sister
of Clovis, Augofleda, who, as we may reasonably
conjecture, renounced the worship of the gods of
her people, and was baptised by an Arian bishop on
becoming "Queen of the Goths and Romans". Unfortunately
the meagre annals of the time give us
no hint of the character or history of the princess
who was thus transferred from the fens of Flanders
to the marshes of Ravenna. Every indication shows
that she came from a far lower level of civilisation
than that which her husband's people occupied.
Did she soon learn to conform herself to the stately
ceremonial which Ravenna borrowed from Constantinople?
Did she too speak of <i>civilitas</i> and the
<a name="p189" id="p189"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 189</span>
necessity of obeying the Roman laws, and did she
share the "glorious colloquies" which her husband
held with the exuberant Cassiodorus? When war
came between the Ostrogoth and the Frank, did
she openly show her sympathy with her brother
Clovis, or did she "forget her people and her father's
house" and cleave with all her soul to the fortunes of
Theodoric? As to all these interesting questions the
"Various Letters", with all their diffuseness, give us no
more information than the most jejune of the annalists.
The only fact upon which we might found a conjecture
is the love of literature and of Roman civilisation
displayed by her daughter, Amalasuentha,
which inclines us to guess that the mother may have
thrown off her Frankish wildness when she came
into the softening atmosphere of Italy.</p>

<p>We return to the event so memorable in the
history of the world, Clovis' conversion to Christianity.
In the year 486 he went forth to fight his
barbarian neighbours in the south-east, the Alamanni,
The battle was a stubborn and a bloody one, as well it
might be when two such thunder-clouds met, the
savage Frank and the savage Alaman. Already the
Frankish host seemed wavering, when Clovis, lifting
his eyes to heaven and shedding tears in the agony
of his soul, said: "O Jesus Christ! whom Clotilda
declares to be the son of the living God, who art
said to give help to the weary, and victory to them
that trust in thee, I humbly pray for thy glorious
aid, and promise that if thou wilt indulge me with
the victory over these enemies, I will believe in
thee and be baptised in thy name. For I have
<a name="p190" id="p190"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 190</span>
called on my own gods and have found that they
are of no power and do not help those who call
upon them". Scarcely had he spoken the words
when the tide of battle turned. The Franks recovered
from their panic, the Alamanni turned to flight.
Their king was slain, and his people submitted to
Clovis, who, returning, told his queen how he had
called upon her God in the day of battle and been
delivered.</p>

<p>Then followed, after a short consultation with the
leading men of his kingdom, which made the change
of faith in some degree a national act, the celebrated
scene in the cathedral of Rheims, where the king,
having confessed his faith in the Holy Trinity, was
baptised in the name of the Father and the Son and
the Holy Ghost, the poetical bishop uttering the
well-known words:"Bow down thy head in lowliness,
O Sicambrian; adore what thou hast burned and
burn what thou hast adored". The streets of the
city were hung with bright banners, white curtains
adorned the churches, and clouds of sweet incense
filled all the great basilica in which "the new Constantine"
stooped to the baptismal water. He
entered the cathedral a mere "Sicambrian" chieftain,
the descendant of the sea-god: he emerged
from it amid the acclamations of the joyous provincials,
"the eldest son of the Church".</p>

<p>The result of this ceremony was to change the
political relations of every state in Gaul. Though
the Franks were among the roughest and most
uncivilised of the tribes that had poured westwards
across the Rhine, as Catholics they were now sure of
<a name="p191" id="p191"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 191</span>
a welcome from the Catholic clergy of every city,
and where the clergy led, the "Roman" provincials,
or in other words the Latin-speaking laity, generally
followed. Immediately after his baptism Clovis
received a letter of enthusiastic welcome Into the
true fold, written by Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, the
most eminent ecclesiastic of the Burgundian kingdom.
"I regret", says Avitus, "that I could not be
present in the flesh at that most glorious solemnity.
But as your most sublime Humility had sent me a
messenger to inform me of your intention, when
night fell I retired to rest already secure of your
conversion. How often my friends and I went over
the scene in our imaginations! We saw the band of
holy prelates vying with one another in the ambition
of lowly service, each one wishing to comfort the
royal limbs with the water of life. We saw that
head, so terrible to the nations, bowed low before
the servants of God; the hair which had grown long
under the helmet now crowned with the diadem of
the holy anointing; the coat of mail laid aside and
the white limbs wrapped in linen robes as white and
spotless as themselves.</p>

<p>"One thing only have I to ask of you, that you
will spread the light which you have yourself received
to the nations around you. Scatter the seeds of
faith from out of the good treasure of your heart,
and be not ashamed, by embassies directed to this
very end, to strengthen in other States the cause of
that God who has so greatly exalted your fortunes.
Shine on, for ever, upon those who are present, by
lustre of your diadem, upon those who are absent, by
<a name="p192" id="p192"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 192</span>
the glory of your name. We are touched by your
happiness; as often as you fight in those (heretical)
lands, <i>we</i> conquer".</p>

<p>The use of language like this, showing such earnest
devotion to the cause of Clovis in the subject of
a rival monarch, well illustrates the tendency of the
Frankish king's conversion to loosen the bonds of
loyalty in the neighbouring States, and to facilitate
the spread of his dominion over the whole of Gaul.
In fact, the Frankish kingdom, having become Catholic,
was like the magnetic mountain of Oriental fable,
which drew to itself all the iron nails of the ships
which approached it, and so caused them to sink in
hopeless dissolution. Seeing this obvious result of
the conversion of the Frank, some historians, especially
in the last century,were disposed to look upon
that conversion as a mere hypocritical pretence.
Later critics<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a>
<a href="#footnote95"><sup class="sml">95</sup></a> have shown that this is not an accurate
account of the matter. Doubtless the motives
which induced Clovis to accept baptism and to profess
faith in the Crucified One were of the meanest,
poorest, and most unspiritual kind. Few men have
ever been further from that which Christ called "the
Kingdom of Heaven" than this grasping and brutal
Frankish chief, to whom robbery, falsehood, murder
were, after his baptism, as much as before it (perhaps
even more than before it), the ordinary steps in the
ladder of his elevation. But the rough barbaric soul
had in its dim fashion a faith that the God of the
Christians was the mightiest God, and that it would
<a name="p193" id="p193"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 193</span>
go well with those who submitted to him. In his
rude style he made imaginary bargains with the
Most High: "so much reverence to 'Clotilda's God,'
so many offerings at the shrine of St. Martin, so
much land to the church of St. Genovefa, on condition
that I shall beat down my enemies before me
and extend my dominions from the Seine to the
Pyrenees". This is the kind of calculation which the
missionaries in our own day are only too well accustomed
to hear from the lips of barbarous potentates
like those of Uganda and Fiji. A conversion thus
effected brings no honour to any church, and the
utter selfishness and even profanity of the transaction
disgusts the devout souls of every communion.
Still the conversion of Clovis was not in its essence
and origin a hypocritical scheme for obtaining the
support of the Catholic clergy in Gaul, how clearly
so ever the new convert may have soon perceived
that from that support he would "suck no small
advantage".</p>

Especially Dahn ("Urgeschichte der germanischen Völker",
iii., 61).</blockquote>

<p>The first of his Arian neighbours whom Clovis
struck at was the Burgundian, Gundobad. In the
year 500 he beseiged Dijon with a large army. Gundobad
called on his brother Godegisel, who reigned
at Geneva, for help, but that brother was secretly in
league with Clovis, and at a critical moment joined
the invaders, who were for a time completely
successful. Gundobad was driven into exile
and Godegisel accepting the position of a tributary
ally of his powerful Frankish friend, ruled over the
whole Burgundian kingdom. His rule however seems
not to have been heartily accepted by the Burgundian
<a name="p194" id="p194"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 194</span>
people. The exiled Gundobad returned with
a few followers, who daily increased in number; he
found himself strong enough to besiege Godegisel in
Vienne; he at length entered the city through the
blow-hole of an aqueduct, slew his brother with his
own hand, and put his chief adherents to death
"with exquisite torments". The Frankish troops
who garrisoned Vienne were taken prisoners, but
honourably treated and sent to Toulouse to be
guarded by Alaric the Visigoth, who had probably
assisted the enterprise of Gundobad.</p>

<p>The inactivity of Clovis during this counter-revolution
in Burgundy is not easily explained. Either
there was some great explosion of Burgundian
national feeling against the Franks, which for the
time made further interference dangerous, or Gundobad,
having added his brother's dominions to his
own, was now too strong for Clovis to meddle with,
or, which seems on the whole the most probable supposition,
Gundobad himself, secretly inclining towards
the Catholic cause, had made peace with Clovis
through the mediation of the clergy, and came back
to Vienne to rule thenceforward as a dependent
ally, though not an avowed tributary, of Clovis and
the Franks. We shall soon have occasion to observe
that in the crisis of its fortunes the confederacy of
Arian states could not count on the co-operation of
Gundobad.</p>

<p>To form such a confederacy and to league together
all the older Arian monarchies against this one aspiring
Catholic state, which threatened to absorb them
all, was now the main purpose of Theodoric. He
<a name="p195" id="p195"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 195</span>
seems, however, to have remained meanwhile on
terms of courtesy and apparent harmony with his
powerful brother-in-law.</p>

<p>He congratulated him on
a second victorious campaign against the Alamanni
(about 503 or 504), and he took some trouble to
comply with a request, which Clovis had made to him,
to find out a skilful harper who might be sent
to his court. The letter<a id="footnotetag96" name="footnotetag96"></a>
<a href="#footnote96"><sup class="sml">96</sup></a> which relates to this transaction is a curious specimen of Cassiodorus' style.
It is addressed to the young philosopher Boëthius, a
man whose varied accomplishments adorned the middle
period of the reign of Theodoric, and whose tragical
death was to bring sadness over its close. To this
man, whose knowledge of the musical art was pre-eminent
in his generation, Cassiodorus addresses one
of the longest letters in his collection (it would occupy
about six pages of an ordinary octavo), only one or
two sentences of which relate to the business in hand.
The letter begins: "Since the king of the Franks,
attracted by the fame of our banquets, has with
earnest prayers besought us to send him a harper
(<i>citharœdus</i>), our only hope of executing his commission
lies in you, whom we know to be accomplished
in musical learning. For it will be easy for you to
choose a well-skilled man, having yourself been able
to attain to that high and abstruse study". Then
follow a string of reflections on the soothing power
of music, a description of the five "modes"<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a>
<a href="#footnote97"><sup class="sml">97</sup></a> (Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian, Ionian, and Lydian) and of
the diapason; instances of the power of music drawn
from the Scriptures and from heathen mythology, a
<a name="p196" id="p196"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 196</span>
discussion on the harmony of the spheres, and a
doubt whether the enjoyment of this "astral music"
be rightly placed among the delights of heaven. At
length the marvellous state-paper draws to a close,
"But since we have made this pleasing digression<a id="footnotetag98" name="footnotetag98"></a>
<a href="#footnote98"><sup class="sml">98</sup></a>
(because it is always agreeable to talk about learning
with learned men) let your Wisdom choose out for
us the best harper of the day, for the purpose that
we have mentioned. Herein will you accomplish a
task somewhat like that of Orpheus, when he with
sweet sounds tamed the fierce hearts of savage
creatures. The thanks which we owe you will be
expressed by liberal compensation, for you obey our
rule, and to the utmost of your power render it illustrious
by your attainments".</p>

<p>Evidently the court of Theodoric was regarded as
a centre of light and civilisation by his Teutonic
neighbours, the lords of the new kingdoms to the
north of him. King Gundobad desired to become
the possessor of a <i>clepsydra</i> or water-clock, such as
had long been used in Athens and Rome, to regulate
the time allotted to the orators in public debates. He
also wished to obtain an accurately graduated sun-dial.
For both he made request to Theodoric, and
again<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a>
<a href="#footnote99"><sup class="sml">99</sup></a> the universal genius Boëthius was applied to,
Cassiodorus writes him, in his master's name, a letter
which gives us some interesting information as to the
past career of Boëthius, and then proceeds to give a
specification of the required machines, in language so
magnificent as to be, at any rate to modern mechanicians,
hopelessly unintelligible. Then a shorter letter,
to accompany the clock and dial, is written to King
Gundobad. This letter, which is written in a slightly
condescending tone, says that the tie of affinity between
the two kings makes it right that Gundobad
should receive benefits from Theodoric: "Let Burgundy
under your sway learn to examine the most
curious objects, and to praise the inventions of the
ancients. Through you she is laying aside her old barbarian
tastes, and while she admires the prudence of
her King she rightly desires the works of wise men of
old. Let her mark out the different intervals of the
day by her actions: let her in the most fitting manner
assign the occupation of each hour. This is to
lead the true human life, as distinguished from that
of the brutes, who know the flight of time only by
the cravings of their appetites".</p>

Strictly speaking not "again" but "previously", for the letter about the water-clock precedes the letter about the harper.</blockquote>

<p>A time, however, was approaching when this pleasant
interchange of courtesies between the three
sovereigns, Ostrogothic, Frankish, and Burgundian,
was to be succeeded by the din of wan Alaric the
Visigoth, alarmed at the victorious progress of the
Frankish king, sent a message to this effect: "If my
brother is willing, let him consider my proposal that,
by the favour of God, we should have an interview
with one another". Clovis accepted the offer, and
the two kings met on an island in the Loire near
Amboise.<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a>
<a href="#footnote100"><sup class="sml">100</sup></a> But either no alliance could be formed,
<a name="p198" id="p198"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 198</span>
owing to religious differences, or the treaty so made
was too weak for the strain which it had to bear,
and it became manifest before long that war would
soon break out between "Francia" and "Gothia".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote100"
name="footnote100"></a><b>Footnote 100:</b><a href="#footnotetag100">
(return) </a>
We have no date given us for this meeting, and the whole sequence of events between the Burgundian and Visigothic wars of Clovis (500-507) can only be stated conjecturally.</blockquote>

<p>Theodoric exerted himself strenuously to prevent
the impending struggle, which, as he too surely foresaw,
would bring only disaster to his Visigothic
allies. He caused his eloquent secretary to write
letters to Clovis, to Alaric, to Gundobad, to the
neighbours of the Franks on their eastern border,
the kings of the Heruli, the Warni, and the Thuringians.
To Clovis he dilated on the horrors which
war brings upon the inhabitants of the warring lands,
who have a right to expect that the kinship of their
lords will keep them at peace. A few paltry words
were no sufficient cause of war between two such
monarchs, and it was the act of a passionate and
hot-headed man to be mobilising his troops while he
was sending his first embassy. To Alaric he sent an
earnest warning against engaging in war with Clovis:
"You are surrounded by an innumerable multitude
of subjects, and you are proud of the remembrance
of the defeat of Attila, but war is a terribly dangerous
game, and you know not how the long peace
may have softened the warlike fibre of your people".
He besought Gundobad to join with him in preserving
peace between the combatants, to each of whom
he had offered his arbitration. "It behoves us old, men to moderate the wrath of the royal youths, who should reverence our age, though they are still in the flower of their hot youth".<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a>
<a href="#footnote101"><sup class="sml">101</sup></a> The kings of the barbarians
<a name="p199" id="p199"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 199</span>
were reminded of the friendship which Alaric's
father, Euric, had shown them in old days, and invited
to join in a "League of Peace", in order to
check the lawless aggressions of Clovis, which threatened
danger to all.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote101"
name="footnote101"></a><b>Footnote 101:</b><a href="#footnotetag101">
(return) </a>
There is some difficulty in understanding this remark about the relative ages of the sovereigns If we put the date of the letters at
506 (and a later date is hardly possible, nor one more than two or
three years earlier), though Gundobad might well be over sixty, Theodoric himself could be only fifty-two, while on the other hand the "regii juvenes", Clovis and Alaric, were about forty. But <i>senex</i> and <i>juvenis</i> are expressions often used with no great exactness; and I conjecture that the cares and struggles of Theodoric's early manhood had made him an old man before his time.</blockquote>

<p>The diplomatic action of Theodoric was powerless
to avert the war; possibly even it may have stimulated
Clovis to strike rapidly before a hostile coalition
could be formed against him.</p>

<p>At an assembly of his
nation (perhaps the "Camp of March") in the early
part of 507, he impetuously declared: "I take it
grievously amiss that these Arians should hold so
large a part of Gaul. Let us go and overcome
them with God's help, and bring the
land into subjection to us". The saying pleased
the whole multitude, and the collected army
inarched southward to the Loire. On their way
they passed through the territory owned by the
monastery of St. Martin of Tours, the greatest
saint of Gaul. Here the king commanded them
to abstain religiously from all depredations, taking
only grass for their horses, and water from the
streams. One of the soldiers, finding a quantity
of hay in the possession of a peasant, took it
from him, arguing that hay was grass, and so came
within the permitted exception. He was, however,
at once cut down with a sword, the king exclaiming.
<a name="p200" id="p200"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 200</span>
"What hope shall we have of victory if we
offend the blessed Martin?" Having first prayed
for a sign, Clovis sent his messengers with gifts to
the great basilica of Tours, and behold! when these
messengers set foot in the sacred building, the choristers
were singing an antiphon, taken from the 18th
Psalm: "Thou hast girded me with strength unto
the battle, thou hast subdued under me those that
rose up against me".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alaric, taken at unawares, short of
men and short of money, was endeavouring to remedy
the latter deficiency by a depreciation of the
currency. To swell his slender battalions he evidently
looked to his father-in-law, Theodoric, whose
peace-making letter had ended with these words:
"We look upon your enemy as the common enemy
of all. Whoever strives against you will rightly have
to deal with me, as a foe". Yet notwithstanding
this assurance, no Ostrogothic troops came at this
time to the help of the Visigoths. In the great
dearth of historical material, our account of these
transactions has to be made up from scattered and
fragmentary notices, which do not enable us to explain
this strange inaction of so true-hearted an ally.
It is not imputed to him as a fault by any contemporary
authority, and it seems reasonable to suppose
that not the will, but the power, to help his menaced
son-in-law was wanting. One alarming change
in the situation had revealed itself since Theodoric
ordered his secretary to write the letters recommending
an anti-Frankish confederacy of kings. Gundobad
the Burgundian was now the declared ally of
<a name="p201" id="p201"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 201</span>
Clovis, and promised himself a share of the spoil.
So powerful an enemy on the flank, threatening the
communications of the two Gothic states, may very
probably have been the reason why no timely succour
was sent from Ravenna to Toulouse.</p>

<p>Clovis and his Frankish host, hungering for the
spoil, pressed forwards, and succeeded, apparently
without opposition, in crossing the broad river Loire.
Alaric had taken up a strong position at the Campus
Vogladensis (<i>Vouillé: dep. Vienne</i>), about ten miles
from Poitiers. Here he wished to remain on the
defensive till the expected succours from Theodoric
could arrive, but his soldiers, confident in their power
to beat the Franks unassisted, began to revile their
king's over-caution and his father-in-law's delay, and
forced Alaric to fight.<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a>
<a href="#footnote102"><sup class="sml">102</sup></a> The Goths began hurling
their missile weapons, but the daring Franks rushed
in upon them and commenced a hand-to-hand encounter,
in which they were completely victorious.
The Goths turned to flee, and Clovis, riding up to
where Alaric was fighting, slew him with his own
hand. He himself had immediately afterwards a
narrow escape from two of the enemy, who, coming
suddenly upon him, thrust their long spears at him,
one on each side. The strength of his coat of mail,
however, and the speed of his horse saved him from
a disaster which might possibly even then have turned
the tide of victory.</p>

This statement as to the battle being forced on, contrary to the
wishes of Alaric, rests only on the authority of Procopius, not a contemporary

campaign.</blockquote>

<a name="p202" id="p202"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 202</span>

<p>The result of this battle was the complete overthrow
of the Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse. In a
certain sense it survived, and for two centuries
played a great part in Europe as the Spanish kingdom
of Toledo, but, as competitors for dominion in
Gaul, the Visigoths henceforward disappear from
history. There seems to have been a certain want
of toughness in the Visigothic fibre, a tendency to
rashness combined with a tendency to panic, which
made it possible for their enemies to achieve a complete
triumph over them in a single battle.</p>

<p>(376)
Athanaric staked his all on one battle with the Huns,
and lost, by the rivers of Bessarabia.</p>

<p>(507)
Alaric II., as we have seen, staked his all on one battle
with the Franks, and lost, on the Campus Vogladensis.</p>

<p>(701)
Two centuries later Roderic staked
his all upon one battle with the Moors, and lost,
at Xeres de la Frontera.</p>

<p>All through the year 507 the allied forces of Franks and Burgundians
seem to have poured over the south-west and south
of Gaul, annexing Angoulème, Saintonge, Auvergne,
and Gascony to the dominions of Clovis, and Provence
to the dominions of Gundobad. Only the
strong city of Aries, and perhaps the fortress of
Carcassonne (that most interesting relic of the early
Middle Ages, which still shows the handiwork of
Visigothic kings in its walls), still held out for the
son of Alaric.</p>

<p>In 508 the long delayed forces of Theodoric
appeared upon the scene under his brave general,
Tulum, and dealt some severe blows at the allied
Frankish and Burgundian armies. In 509 another
<a name="p203" id="p203"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 203</span>
army, under Duke Mammo, crossed the Cottian
Alps near Briancon, laid waste part of Dauphiné,
and probably compelled a large detachment of the
Burgundian army to return for the defence of their
homes. And lastly, in 510, Theodoric's general,
Ibbas, inflicted a crushing defeat on the allied armies,
leaving, it is said, thirty thousand Franks dead upon
the field. The number is probably much exaggerated
(as these historical bulletins are apt to be), but there
can be no doubt that a great and important victory
was won by the troops of Theodoric. The immediate
result of this victory was the raising of the siege
of Aries, whose valiant defenders had held out
against storm and blockade, famine and treachery
within, Franks and Burgundians without, for the
space of two years and a half. Ultimately, and perhaps
before many months had passed, the victory of
Ibbas led to a cessation of hostilities, if not to a
formal treaty of peace, between the three powers
which disputed the possession of Gaul. The terms
practically arranged were these. Clovis remained
in possession of far the largest part of Alaric's
dominions, Aquitaine nearly up to the roots of the
Pyrenees, and so much of Languedoc (including
Toulouse, the late capital of the Visigoths) as lay
west of the mountains of the Cevennes. Theodoric
obtained the rest of Languedoc and Provence, the
first province being deemed to be a part of the
Visigothic, the second of the Ostrogothic, dominions,
Gundobad obtained nothing, but lost some towns
on his southern frontier--a fitting reward for his
tortuous and shifty policy.</p>

<a name="p204" id="p204"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 204</span>

<p>In the meantime something like civil war had
been waged on the other side of the Pyrenees for
the Spanish portion of the Visigothic inheritance.
Alaric, slain on the field of Vouillé, had left two
sons, one Amalaric, his legitimate heir and the
grandson of Theodoric, but still a child, the other a
young man, but of illegitimate birth, named Gesalic.
This latter was, on the death of his father, proclaimed
king by some fraction of the Visigothic people.
Had Gesalic shown courage and skill in winning back
the lost inheritance of his father, Theodoric, whose
own descent was not legitimate according to strict
church law, would not, perhaps, have interfered with
his claim to the succession. But the young man was
as weak and cowardly as his birth was base, and the
strenuous efforts of Theodoric, seconded probably
by many of the Visigoths who had first acclaimed
him as king, were directed to getting rid of this
futile pretender. Gesalic, defeated by Gundobad at
Narbonne (which, for a time, became the possession
of the Burgundians), fled over the Pyrenees to Barcelona,
and from thence across the sea to Carthage.
Thrasamund, king of the Vandals, aided him with
money and promised him support, being probably
deceived by the glozing tongue of Gesalic, and
looking upon him simply as a brave young Visigoth
battling for his rightful inheritance with the Franks.
A correspondence followed between Ravenna and
Carthage, in which Theodoric bitterly complained
of the protection given by his brother-in-law to
an intriguer and a rebel; and, on the receipt of
Theodoric's letter, Thrasamund at once disclaimed
<a name="p205" id="p205"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 205</span>
all further intention of helping the pretender and
sent rich presents to his offended kinsman, which
Theodoric graciously returned. Gesalic again appeared
in Barcelona, still doubtless wearing the
insignia of kingship, but was defeated by the same
Duke Ibbas who had raised the siege of Aries, and,
fleeing into Gaul, probably in order to claim the protection
of the enemy of his house, King Gundobad, he
was overtaken by the soldiers of Theodoric near the
river Durance, and was put to death by his captors.
Thus there remained but one undisputed heir to
what was left of the great Visigothic kingdom, the
little child Amalaric, Theodoric's grandson. He was
brought up in Spain, but, apparently with the full
consent of the Visigothic people, his grandsire assumed
the reins of government, ruling in his own
name but with a tacit understanding that
Amalaric and no other should succeed him.</p>

<p>(510-525) There was thus for fifteen years a combination
of states which Europe has not witnessed before or
since, though Charles V. and some of his descendants
were not far from achieving it. All of Italy
and all of Spain (except the north-west corner, which
was held by the Suevi) obeyed the rule of Theodoric,
and the fair regions of Provence and Languedoc,<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a>
<a href="#footnote103"><sup class="sml">103</sup></a>
acknowledging the same master, were the ligament
that united them. Of the character of the government
of Theodoric in Spain, history tells us scarcely
anything; but there is reason to think that it was as
wise and beneficent as his government of Italy, its
chief fault being probably the undue share of power
<a name="p206" id="p206"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 206</span>
which was grasped by the Ostrogothic minister
Theudis, whom Theodoric had appointed as guardian
to his grandson, and who, having married a
wealthy Spanish lady, assumed a semi-royal state,
and became at last so mighty that Theodoric himself
did not dare to insist upon the recall which he had
veiled under the courteous semblance of an invitation
to his palace at Ravenna.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote103"
name="footnote103"></a><b>Footnote 103:</b><a href="#footnotetag103">

<p>Thus then the policy of Theodoric towards his kinsmen
and co-religionists in Gaul had failed, but it had
not been a hopeless failure. He had missed, probably
through no fault of his own, through the rashness
of Alaric and the treachery of Gundobad, the
right moment for saving the kingdom of Toulouse
from shipwreck, but he had vindicated in adversity
the honour of the Gothic name, and he had succeeded
in saving a considerable part of the cargo
which the stately vessel had carried.</p>

Sinnium and its consequences--Raid on the coast of Italy--Reconciliation between the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople--Anastasius

<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/038.png">n order to complete our survey of
the foreign policy of the great Ostrogoth,
we must now consider the
relations which existed between
him and the majestic personage
who, though he had probably
never set foot in Italy, was yet
always known in the common
speech of men as "The Roman
Emperor". It has been already said that Zeno,
the sovereign who bore this title when Theodoric
started for Italy, died before his final victory, and
that it was his successor, Anastasius, with whom
<a name="p208" id="p208"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 208</span>
the tedious negotiations were conducted which ended
(497) in a recognition, perhaps a somewhat grudging
recognition, by the Emperor of the right of the
Ostrogothic king to rule in Italy.</p>

<p>Anastasius, who was Theodoric's contemporary
during twenty-five years of his reign, was already
past sixty when the widowed Empress Ariadne
chose him for her husband and her Emperor, and
he had attained the age of eighty-eight when his
harassed life came to a close. A man of tall stature
and noble presence, a wise administrator of the
finances of the Empire, and therefore one who both
lightened taxation and accumulated treasure, a sovereign
who chose his servants well and brought his
only considerable war, that with Persia, to a successful
issue, Anastasius would seem to be an Emperor
of whom both his own subjects and posterity should
speak favourably. Unfortunately, however, for his
fame he became entangled in that most wearisome
of theological debates, which is known as the Monophysite
controversy. In this controversy he took
an unpopular side; he became embroiled with the
Roman Pontiff, and estranged from his own Patriarch
of Constantinople. Opposition and the weariness
of age soured a naturally sweet temper, and he
was guilty of some harsh proceedings towards his
ecclesiastical opponents. Even worse than his harshness
(which did not, even on the representations of
his enemies, amount to cruelty) was a certain want
of absolute truthfulness, which made it difficult for a
beaten foe to trust his promises of forgiveness, and
thus caused the fire of civil discord, once kindled, to
<a name="p209" id="p209"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 209</span>
smoulder on almost interminably. The religious
party to which he belonged had probably the majority
of the aristocracy of Constantinople on its
side, but the mob and the monks were generally
against Anastasius, and some scenes very humiliating
to the Imperial dignity were the consequence
of this antagonism.</p>

<p>(511) Once, when he had resolved
on the deposition of the orthodox Patriarch
of Constantinople, Macedonius, so great a tempest
of popular and theological fury raged through the
city, that he ordered the great gates of his palace to
be barred and the ships to be made ready at what is
now called Seraglio Point, intending to seek safety
in flight. A humiliating reconciliation with the
Patriarch, the order for whose banishment he rescinded,
saved him from this necessity. The citizens
and the soldiers poured through the streets
shouting triumphantly: "Our father is yet with us!"
and the storm for the time abated. But the Emperor
had only appeared to yield, and some months
later he stealthily but successfully carried into effect
his design for the banishment of Macedonius. Again,
the next year, a religious faction-fight disgraced
the capital of the Empire.</p>

<p>(511) The addition of the words "Who wast crucified for us" to
the chorus of the Te Deum, "Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord God Almighty", goaded the orthodox but
fanatical mob to madness. For three days such
scenes as London saw during Lord George Gordon's
"No Popery" riots were enacted in the streets of
Constantinople. The palaces of the heterodox ministers
were burned, their deaths were eagerly demanded,
<a name="p210" id="p210"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 210</span>
the head of a monk, who was supposed to
be responsible for the heretical addition to the
hymn, was carried round the city on a pole, while
the murderers shouted: "Behold the head of an
enemy to the Trinity!" Then the statues of the
Emperor were thrown down, an act of insurrection
which corresponded to the building of barricades
in the revolutions of Paris, and loud voices
began to call for the proclamation of a popular general
as Augustus. Anastasius this time dreamed
not of flight, but took his seat in the <i>podium</i><a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a>
<a href="#footnote104"><sup class="sml">104</sup></a> at
the Hippodrome, the great place of public meeting
for the citizens of Constantinople. Thither, too,
streamed the excited mob, fresh from their work of
murder and pillage, shouting with hoarse voices the
line of the Te Deum in its orthodox form. A suppliant,
without his diadem, without his purple robe,
the white-haired Anastasius, eighty-two years of
age, sat meekly on his throne, and bade the criers
declare that he was ready to lay down the burden
of the Empire if the citizens would decide who
should assume it in his stead. The humiliation was
accepted, the clamorous mob were not really of one
mind as to the election of a successor, and Anastasius
was permitted still to reign and to reassume
the diadem, which has not often encircled a wearier
or more uneasy head.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote104"

<p>Such an Emperor as this, at war with a large part
of his subjects, and suspected of heresy by the great
body of the Catholic clergy, was a much less formidable
opponent for Theodoric than the young
<a name="p211" id="p211"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 211</span>
and warlike Clovis, with his rude energy, and his
unquestioning if somewhat truculent orthodoxy.
Moreover, at this time, independently of these
special causes of strife, there was a chronic schism
between the see of Rome and the see of Constantinople
(precursor of that great schism which, three
centuries later, finally divided the Eastern and Western
Churches), and this schism, though it did not as
yet lead to the actual excommunication of Anastasius,<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a>
<a href="#footnote105"><sup class="sml">105</sup></a>
caused him to be looked upon with coldness
and suspicion by the successive Popes of Rome,
and made the rule of Theodoric, avowed Arian as
he was, but anxious to hold the balance evenly between
rival churches, far more acceptable at the

<p>For some years after the embassy of Festus (497)
and the consequent recognition of Theodoric by the
Emperor, there appears to have been peace, if no
great cordiality, between the courts of Ravenna and
Constantinople. But a war in which Theodoric
found himself engaged with the Gepidæ (504), taking
him back as it did into his old unwelcome nearness
to the Danube, led to the actual outbreak of hostilities
between the two States, hostilities, however,
which were but of short duration.</p>

<p>The great city of Sirmium on the Save, the ruins of
which may still be seen about eighty miles west of
<a name="p212" id="p212"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 212</span>
Belgrade, had once belonged to the Western Empire
and had been rightly looked upon as one of the
bulwarks of Italy. To anyone who studies the configuration
of the great Alpine chain, which parts off the
Italian peninsula from the rest of Europe, it will be
manifest that it is in the north-east that that mountain
barrier is the weakest. The Maritime, Pennine,
and Cottian Alps, which soar above the plains of
Piedmont and Western Lombardy, afford scarcely
any passes below the snow-line practicable for an
invading army. Great generals, like Hannibal and
Napoleon, have indeed crossed them, but the pride
which they have taken in the achievement is the
best proof of its difficulty. Modern engineering
science has carried its zig-zag roads up to their high
crests, has thrown its bridges across their ravines, has
defended the traveller by its massive galleries from
their avalanches, and in these later days has even
bored its tunnels for miles through the heart of the
mountains; but all these are works done obviously in
defiance of Nature, and if Europe relapsed into a
state of barbarism, the eternal snow and the eternal
silence would soon reassert their supremacy over
the frail handiwork of man. Quite different from this
is the aspect of the mountains on the north-eastern
border of Italy. The countries which we now call
Venetia and Istria are parted from their northern
neighbours by ranges (chiefly that known as the
Julian Alps) which are indeed of bold and striking
outline, but which are not what we generally understand
by "Alpine" in their character, and which
often do not rise to a greater elevation than four thousand
<a name="p213" id="p213"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 213</span>
feet. Therefore it was from this quarter of the
horizon, from the Pannonian (or in modern language,
Austrian) countries bordering on the Middle
Danube, that all the greatest invaders in the fifth
and sixth centuries, Alaric, Attila, Alboin, bore
down upon Italy. And for this reason it was
truly said by an orator<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a>
<a href="#footnote106"><sup class="sml">106</sup></a> who was recounting the
praises of Theodoric in connection with this war:
"The city of the Sirmians was of old the frontier of
Italy, upon which Emperors and Senators kept
watch, lest from thence the stored up fury of the
neighbouring nations should pour over the Roman
Commonwealth".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote106"

<p>This city of Sirmium, however, and the surrounding
territory had now been for many years divorced
from Italy. In Theodoric's boyhood it is possible
that his own barbarian countrymen, occupying as
they did the province of Pannonia, lorded it in the
streets of Sirmium, which was properly a Pannonian
city. Since the Ostrogoths evacuated the province
(473), the Gepidæ, as we have seen, had entered it,
and it was a king of the Gepidæ, Traustila, who
sought to bar Theodoric's march into Italy, and who
sustained at the hands of the Ostrogothic king the
crushing defeat by the Hiulca Palus (488). Traustila's
son, Trasaric, had asked for Theodoric's help
against a rival claimant to the throne, and had, perhaps,
promised to hand over possession of Sirmium in
return for that assistance. Theodoric, who, as king
of "the Hesperian realm", felt that it was a point of
honour to recover possession of "the frontier city
<a name="p214" id="p214"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 214</span>
of Italy", gave the desired help, but failed to receive
the promised recompense. When Trasaric's breach
of faith was manifest, Theodoric sent an army
(504) composed of the flower of the Gothic youth,
commanded by a general named Pitzias, into the
valley of the Save. The Gepidaæ, though reinforced
by some of the Bulgarians (who about thirty years
before this time had made their first appearance in
the country which now bears their name), were completely
defeated by Pitzias. Trasaric's mother, the
widow of Theodoric's old enemy, Traustila, fell into
the hands of the invaders; Trasaric was expelled
from that corner of Pannonia, and Sirmium, still
apparently a great and even opulent city, notwithstanding
the ravages of the barbarians, submitted,
probably with joy, to the rule of Theodoric, under
which she felt herself once more united to the Roman
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>We have still (in the "Various Letters" of Cassiodorus)
two letters relating to this annexation of
Sirmium. In the first, addressed to Count Colossæus,
that "Illustrious" official is informed that he
is appointed to the governorship of Pannonia Sirmiensis,
a former habitation of the Goths. This province
is now to extend a welcome to her old Roman lords,
even as she gladly obeyed her Ostrogothic rulers.
Surrounded by the wild anarchy of the barbarous
nations, the new governor is to exhibit the justice of
the Goths, "a nation so happily situated in the
midst of praise, that they could accept the wisdom
of the Romans and yet hold fast the valour of the
barbarians". He is to shield the poor from oppression,
<a name="p215" id="p215"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 215</span>
and his highest merit will be to establish in the
hearts of the inhabitants of the land the love of peace
and order.</p>

<p>To the barbarians and Romans settled in Pannonia
the secretary of Theodoric writes, informing them that
he has appointed as their governor a man mighty in
name (Colossæus) and mighty in deeds. They must
refrain from acts of violence and from redressing their
supposed wrongs by main force. Having got an
upright judge, they must use him as the arbiter of
their differences. What is the use to man of his
tongue, if his armed hand is to settle his cause, or
how can peace be maintained if men take to fighting
in a civilised State? They are therefore to imitate
the example of "our Goths", who do not shrink
from battles abroad, but who have learned to exhibit
peaceable moderation at home.</p>

<p>The recovery of Sirmium from the Gepidæ, though
doubtless the subject of congratulation in Italy, was
viewed with much displeasure at Constantinople.
Whether the part of Pannonia in which it was included
belonged in strictness to the Eastern or
Western Empire, is a question that has been a good
deal discussed and upon which we have perhaps not
sufficient materials for coming to a conclusion. The
boundary line between East and West had undoubtedly
fluctuated a good deal in the fourth and fifth
centuries, and the fact that there were not, as viewed
by a Roman statesman, two Empires at all, but only
one great World-Empire, which for the sake of convenience
was administered by two Emperors, one
dwelling at Ravenna or Milan and the other at Constantinople,
<a name="p216" id="p216"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 216</span>
was probably the reason why that boundary
was not defined as strictly as it would have
been between two independent kingdoms. Moreover,
through the greater part of the fifth century,
when Huns and Ostrogoths, Rugians and Gepidæ
were roaming over these countries of the Middle
Danube, any claim of either the Eastern or Western
Emperor to rule in these lands must have been so
purely theoretical that it probably seemed hardly
worth while to spend time in defining it. But now
that the actual ruler of Italy, and that ruler a strong
and capable barbarian like Theodoric, was holding
the great city of Sirmium, and was sending his governors
to civilise and subdue the inhabitants of what
is now called the "Austrian Military Frontier", the
Emperor who reigned at Constantinople was not
unlikely to find his neighbourhood unpleasant.</p>

<p>It was doubtless in consequence of the jealousy,
arising from the conquest of Sirmium, that war soon
broke out between the two powers. Upper Mœsia
(in modern geography Servia) was undoubtedly part
of the Eastern Empire, yet it is there that we next find
the Gothic troops engaged in war. (505) Mundo,
the Hun, a descendant of Attila, was in league
with Theodoric, but at enmity with the Empire, and
was wandering with a band of freebooters through the
half desolate lands south of the Danube. Sabinian,
the son of the general of the same name, who twenty-six
years before had fought with Theodoric in
Macedonia, was ordered by Anastasius to exterminate
this disorderly Hun. With 10,000 men (among
whom there were some Bulgarian <i>fœderati</i>), and
<a name="p217" id="p217"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 217</span>
with a long train of waggons containing great store of
provisions, he marched from the Balkans down the
valley of the Morava. Mundo, in despair and already
thinking of surrender, called on his Ostrogothic
ally for aid, and Pitzias, marching rapidly with
an army of 2,500 young and warlike Goths (2,000
infantry and 500 cavalry), reached Horrea Margi,<a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a>
<a href="#footnote107"><sup class="sml">107</sup></a>
the place where Mundo was besieged, in time to
prevent his surrender. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm
of the Gothic troops, the battle was most
stubbornly contested, especially by the fierce Bulgarians,
but in the end Pitzias obtained a complete
victory. We may state this fact with confidence, as
it is recorded in the chronicles of an official of the
Eastern Empire.<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a>
<a href="#footnote108"><sup class="sml">108</sup></a> He says of Sabinian: "Having
joined battle at Horrea Margi, and many of his soldiers
having been slain in this conflict and drowned
in the river Margus <i>(Morava)</i>, having also lost all his
wagons, he fled with a few followers to the fortress
which is called Nato. In this lamentable war so
promising an army fell, that, speaking after the
manner of men, its loss could never be repaired".</p>

<p>Without any general campaign, the quarrel between
the Goths and the Empire seems to have
smouldered on for three years longer. In his chronicle
for the year 508, the same Byzantine official
who has just been quoted, says very honestly: "Romanus
Count of the Domestics and Rusticus Count
of the Scholarii,<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a>
<a href="#footnote109"><sup class="sml">109</sup></a> with 100 armed ships and as many
<a name="p218" id="p218"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 218</span>
cutters, carrying 8,000 soldiers, went forth to ravage
the shores of Italy, and proceeded as far as the most
ancient city of Tarentum. Having recrossed the sea
they reported to Anastasius Cæsar this inglorious
victory, which in piratical fashion Romans had
snatched from their fellow-Romans".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote109"
name="footnote109"></a><b>Footnote 109:</b><a href="#footnotetag109">
(return) </a> Both these terms denote what we should call "household troops".</blockquote>

<p>These words of the chronicler show to what extent
Theodoric's kingdom was looked upon as still forming
part of the Roman Empire, and they also point
to the difficulty of the position of Anastasius, who,
whatever might be his cause of quarrel with Theodoric,
could only enforce his complaints against him
by resorting to acts which in the eyes of his subjects
wore the unholy appearance of a civil war.</p>

<p>Though we are not precisely informed when or
how hostilities were brought to a close, it seems
probable that soon after this raid, about the year
509, peace, unbroken for the rest of Theodoric's
reign, was re-established between Ravenna and
Byzantium. The Epistle which stands in the forefront
of the "Various Letters" of Cassiodorus was
probably written on this occasion.</p>

<p>"Most clement Emperor", says Theodoric, or
rather Cassiodorus speaking in his name, "there
ought to be peace between us since there is no
real occasion for animosity. Every kingdom should
desire tranquillity, since under it the people flourish
and the common good is secured. Tranquillity is the
comely mother of all useful arts; she multiplies the
race of men as they perish and are renewed; she
expands our powers, she softens our manners, and
he who is a stranger to her sway grows up in ignorance
<a name="p219" id="p219"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 219</span>
of all these blessings. Therefore, most pious
Prince, it redounds to your glory that we should
now seek harmony with your government, as we
have ever felt love for your person. For you are
the fairest ornament of all realms, the safeguard and
defence of the world; to whom all other rulers rightly
look up with reverence, inasmuch as they recognise
that there is in you something which exists nowhere
else. But we pre-eminently thus regard you, since
by Divine help it was in your Republic that we
learned the art of ruling the Romans with justice.
Our kingdom is an imitation of yours, which is the
mould of all good purposes, the only model of
Empire, Just in so far as we follow you do we
surpass all other nations.</p>

<p>"You have often exhorted me to love the Senate,
to accept cordially the legislation of the Emperors,
to weld together all the members of Italy. Then, if
you wish thus to form my character by your counsels,
how can you exclude me from your august peace?
I may plead, too, affection for the venerable city of
Rome, from which none can separate themselves who
prize that unity which belongs to the Roman name.</p>

<p>"We have therefore thought fit to direct the two
Ambassadors who are the bearers of this letter to
visit your most Serene Piety, that the transparency
of peace between us, which from various causes hath
been of late somewhat clouded, may be restored to-its
former brightness by the removal of all contentions.
For we think that you, like ourselves, cannot
endure that any trace of discord should remain between
two Republics which, under the older Princes,
<a name="p220" id="p220"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 220</span>
ever formed but one body, and which ought not
merely to be joined together by a languid sentiment
of affection, but strenuously to help one another
with their mutually imparted strength. Let there be
always one will, one thought in the Roman kingdom.
... Wherefore, proffering the honourable expression
of our salutation, we beg with humble mind
that you will not even for a time withdraw from us
the most glorious charity of your Mildness, which I
should have a right to hope for even if it were not
granted to others. (The change from We to I, which here occurs in the original, is
puzzling.)</p>

<p>"Other matters we have left to be suggested to
your Piety verbally by the bearers of this letter, that
on the one hand this epistolary speech of ours may
not become too prolix, and on the other that nothing
may be omitted which would tend to our common
advantage".</p>

<p>The letter which I have attempted thus to bring
before the reader is one which almost defies accurate
translation. It is an exceedingly diplomatic document,
full of courtesy, yet committing the writer to
nothing definite. The very badness of his style
enables Cassiodorus to envelop his meaning in a cloud
of words from which the Quæstor of Anastasius
perhaps found it as hard to extract a definite meaning
then, as a perplexed translator finds it hard to
render it into intelligible English now. It is certainly
difficult to acquit Cassiodorus of the charge of a
deficient sense of humour, when we find him putting
into the mouth of his master, who had so often
<a name="p221" id="p221"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 221</span>
marched up and down through Thrace, ravaging and
burning, these solemn praises of "Tranquillity".
And when we read the fulsome flattery which is
lavished on Anastasius, the almost obsequious humbleness
with which the great Ostrogoth, who was
certainly the stronger monarch of the two, prays for
a renewal of his friendship, we may perhaps suspect
either that the "illiteratus Rex" did not comprehend
the full meaning of the document to which he attached
his signature, or that Cassiodorus himself, in
his later years, when, after the death of his master, he
republished his "Various Letters", somewhat modified
their diction so as to make them more Roman,
more diplomatic, more slavishly subservient to the
Emperor, than Theodoric himself would ever have
permitted.</p>

<p>One other act of this Emperor must be noticed, as
illustrating the subject of the last chapter. When
Clovis returned in triumph from the Visigothic war
(508) he found messengers awaiting him from Anastasius,
who brought to him some documents from
the Imperial chancery which are somewhat obscurely
described as "Codicils of the Consulship". Then, in
the church of St. Martin at Tours he was robed in
a purple tunic and <i>chlamys,</i> and placed apparently
on his own head some semblance of the Imperial
diadem. At the porch of the basilica he mounted
his horse and rode slowly through the streets of the
city to the other chief church, scattering largesse of
gold and silver to the shouting multitude. "From
that day", we are told, "he was saluted as Consul
and Augustus".</p>

<a name="p222" id="p222"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 222</span>
<p>The name of Clovis does not, like that of Theodoric,
appear in the <i>Fasti</i> of Imperial Rome, and
what the precise nature of the consulship conferred
by the "codicils" may have been, it is not easy to
discover.<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a>
<a href="#footnote110"><sup class="sml">110</sup></a> But there is no doubt that the authority
which Clovis up to this time had exercised by the
mere right of the stronger, over great part of
Gaul, was confirmed and legitimised by this spontaneous
act of the Augustus at Constantinople, nor
that this eager recognition of the royalty of the
slayer of Alaric was meant in some degree as a demonstration
of hostility against Alaric's father-in-law,
with whom Anastasius had not then been reconciled.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote110"
name="footnote110"></a><b>Footnote 110:</b><a href="#footnotetag110">
(return) </a> Perhaps the simplest explanation is that Clovis was not "Consul
ordinarius", but "Consul suffectus". Junghans suggests that he was
Proconsul of one or more of the Gaulish provinces, and Gaudenzi,
accepting this idea, is inclined to call him Proconsul of Narbonese
Gaul.</blockquote>

<p>The coalition of Eastern Emperor and Frankish
King boded no good to Italy. Perhaps could the
eye of Anastasius have pierced through the mists of
seven future centuries, could he have foreseen the
insults, the extortions, the cruelties which a Roman
Emperor at Constantinople was to endure at the
hands of "Frankish" invaders,<a id="footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a>
<a href="#footnote111"><sup class="sml">111</sup></a> he would not have

<p>The remainder of the life of Clovis seems to have
been chiefly spent in removing the royal competitors
who were obstacles to his undisputed sway over the
Franks. Doubtless these were kings of a poor and
<a name="p223" id="p223"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 223</span>
barbarous type, with narrower and less statesmanlike
views than those of the founder of the Merovingian
dynasty; but the means employed to remove them
were hardly such as we should have expected from
the eldest Son of the Church, from him who had
worn the white robe of a catechumen in the baptistery
at Rheims. His most formidable competitor
was Sigebert, king of the Ripuarian Franks, that is
the Franks dwelling on both banks of the Rhine
between Maintz and Koln, in the forest of the Ardennes
and along the valley of the Moselle. But
Sigebert, who had sent a body of warriors to help
the Salian king in his war against the Visigoths, was
now growing old, and among these barbarous peoples
age and bodily infirmity were often considered as to
some extent disqualifications for kingship. Clovis
accordingly sent messengers to Cloderic, the son of
Sigebert, saying: "Behold thy father has grown old
and is lame on his feet. If he were to die, his kingdom
should be thine and we would be thy friends".
Cloderic yielded to the temptation, and when his
father went forth from Koln on a hunting expedition
in the beech-forests of Hesse, assassins employed
by Cloderic stole upon him in his tent, as he was
taking his noon-tide slumber, and slew him. The
deed being done, Cloderic sent messengers to Clovis
saying: "My father is dead and his treasures are
mine. Send me thy messengers to whom I may
confide such portion of the treasure as thou mayest
desire". "Thanks", said Clovis, "I will send my
messengers, and do thou show them all that thou
hast, yet thou thyself shalt still possess all". When
<a name="p224" id="p224"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 224</span>
the messengers of Clovis arrived at the palace of the
Ripuanan, Cloderic showed them all the royal
hoard. "And here", said he, pointing to a chest,
"my father used to keep his gold coins of the Empire". (In hanc arcellolam solitus erat pater meus numismata auri
congerere.)
"Plunge thy hand in", said the messenger,
"and search them down to the very bottom". The
King stooped low to plunge his hand into the coins,
and while he stooped the messenger lifted high his
battle-axe and clove his skull. "Thus", says the
pious Gregory, who tells the story, "did the unworthy
son fall into the pit which he had digged for his
own father".</p>

<p>When Clovis heard that both father and son were
slain, he came to the same place (probably Colonia)
where all these things had come to pass and called
together a great assembly of the Ripuarian people.
"Hear", he said, "what hath happened. While I
was quietly sailing down the Scheldt, Cloderic, my
cousin's son, practised against his father's life, giving
forth that I wished him slain, and when he was fleeing
through the beech-forests he sent robbers against
him, by whom he was murdered. Then Cloderic
himself, when he was displaying his treasures, was
slain by some one, I know not whom. But in all
these things I am free from blame. For I cannot
shed the blood of my relations: that were an unholy
thing to do. But since these events have so happened,
I offer you my advice if it seem good to you
to accept it. Turn you to me that you may be under
my defence". Then they, when they heard these
<a name="p225" id="p225"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 225</span>
things, shouted approval and clashed their spears upon
their shields in sign of assent, and raising Clovis on a
buckler proclaimed him their king. And he receiving
the kingdom and the treasures of Sigebert added
the Ripuanans to the number of his subjects. "For",
concludes Gregory, Bishop of Tours, to whom we
owe the story of this enlargement of the dominions
of his hero, "God was daily laying low the enemies
of Clovis under his hand and increasing his kingdom,
because he walked before him with a right heart and
did those things which were pleasing in his eyes".</p>

<p>This ideal champion of orthodoxy in the sixth
century then proceeded to clear the ground of the
little Salian kings, his nearer relatives and perhaps
more dangerous competitors. Chararic had failed
to help him in his early days against Syagrius. He
was deposed: the long hair of the Merovingians
was shorn away from his head and from his son's
head, and they were consecrated as priest and deacon
in the Catholic Church. Chararic wept and wailed
over his humiliation, but his son, to cheer him, said,
alluding to the loss of their locks: "The wood is
green, and the leaves may yet grow again. Would
that he might quickly perish who has done these
things!" The words were reported to Clovis, who
ordered both father and son to be put to death, and
added their hoards to his treasure, their warriors to
his host.</p>

<p>Chararic had not gone forth to the battle against
Syagrius, but Ragnachar of Cambray had given
Clovis effectual help in that crisis of his early fortunes.
However Ragnachar, by his dissolute life
<a name="p226" id="p226"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 226</span>
and his preposterous fondness for an evil counsellor
named Farro, had given great offence to the proud
Franks, his subjects. Just as James I. said of the forfeited
estates of Raleigh: "I maun hae the land, I
maun hae it for Carr", so Ragnachar said whenever
anyone offered him a present, or whenever a choice
dish was brought to table: "This will do for me and
Farro". Clovis learned and fomented the secret
discontent. He sent to the disaffected nobles amulets
and baldrics of copper-gilt--which they in their
simplicity took for gold,--inviting them to betray
their master. The secret bargain being struck, Clovis
then moved his army towards Cambray. The anxious
Ragnachar sent scouts to discover the strength
of the advancing host. "How many are they?"
said he on their return. "Quite enough for thee
and Farro", was the discouraging and taunting reply:
and in fact the soldiers of Ragnachar seem to have
been beaten as soon as the battle was set in array.
With his hands bound behind his back, Ragnachar
and his brother Richiar were brought into the presence
of Clovis. "Shame on thee", said the indignant
king, "for humiliating our race by suffering thy
hands to be bound. It had been better for thee to
die--thus", and the great battle-axe descended on his
head. Then turning to Richiar, he said: "If thou
hadst helped thy brother, he would not have been
bound"; and his skull too was cloven with the
battle-axe. Before many days the traitorous chiefs
discovered the base metal in the ornaments which
had purchased their treason, and complained of the
fraud. "Good enough gold", said Clovis, "for men
<a name="p227" id="p227"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 227</span>
who were willing to betray their lord to death";
and the traitors, trembling for their lives under his
frown and fierce rebuke, were glad to leave the
matter undiscussed.</p>

<p>Thus in all his arguments with the weaker creatures
around him the Frankish king was always
right. It was always they, not he, who had befouled
the stream. In this, shall I say, shameless plausibility
of wrong, the founder of the Frankish monarchy
was a worthy prototype of Louis XIV. and of
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Having slain these and many other kings, and extended
his dominions over the whole of Gaul, he
once, in an assembly of his nobles, lamented his
solitary estate. "Alas, I am but a stranger and a
pilgrim, and have no kith or kin who could help me
if adversity came upon me". But this he said, not
in real grief for their death, but in guile, in order
that if there were any forgotten relative lurking anywhere
he might come forth and be killed. None,
however, was found to answer to the invitation.<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a>

<p>Like all his family, Clovis was short-lived, though
not so conspicuously short-lived as many of his descendants.
He died at forty-five, in the year 511,
five years after the battle of the Campus Vogladensis.
He was buried (511) in the Church of the Holy
Apostles at Paris, and his kingdom, consolidated
with so much labor and at the price of so
many crimes, was partitioned among his four sons.</p>

<p>The aged Emperor Anastasius survived his Frankish
ally seven years, and died in the eighty-ninth
year of his age, 8th July, 518. His death was sudden,
and some later writers averred that it was
caused by a thunderstorm, of which he had always
had a peculiar and superstitious fear. Others declared
that he was inadvertently buried alive, that he
was heard to cry out in his coffin, and that when it
was opened some days after, he was found to have
gnawed his arm. But these facts are not known to
earlier and more authentic historians, and the invention
of them seems to be only a rhetorical way of
putting the fact that he died at enmity with the
Holy See.</p>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/041.png">he death of Anastasius was followed
by changes in the attitude
towards one another of Pope and
Emperor, which embittered the
closing years of Theodoric and
caused his sun to set in clouds.
But before we occupy ourselves
with these transactions, we may
consider a little more carefully the
relations between Theodoric and his subjects in the
happier days, the early and middle portion of his reign,
and for this purpose we will first of all hear what the
chroniclers have to tell us of a memorable visit to
<a name="p230" id="p230"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 230</span>
Rome which he paid in the eighth year after his
accession, that year which, according to our present
chronology, is marked as the five hundredth after
the birth of Christ.<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a>
<a href="#footnote113"><sup class="sml">113</sup></a></p>

<p>Rome had been for more than two centuries
strangely neglected by the rulers who in her name
lorded it over the civilised world. Ever since Diocletian's
reconstruction of the Empire, it had been a
rare event for an Augustus to be seen within her
walls. Even the Emperor who had Italy for his
portion generally resided at Milan or Ravenna rather
than on the banks of the Tiber. Constantine was
but a hasty visitor before he went eastward to build
his marvellous New Rome beside the Bosphorus.
His son Constantius in middle life paid one memorable
visit(357). Thirty years later Theodosius
followed his example. His son Honorius celebrated
there(403) his doubtful triumph over Alaric, and
his grandson, Valentinian III., was standing in the
Roman Campus Martius when he fell under the
daggers of the avengers of Aëtius. But the fact that
these visits are so pointedly mentioned shows the
extreme rarity of their occurrence; nor was any
great alteration wrought herein by Theodoric, for
this visit to Rome, which we are now about to consider,
and which lasted for six months, seems to have
been the only one that he ever paid in the course of
his reign of thirty-three years.</p>
<a name="p231" id="p231"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 231</span>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote113"
name="footnote113"></a><b>Footnote 113:</b><a href="#footnotetag113">
(return) </a>
The chronology now in use, invented by the monk Dionysius
Exiguus, a friend of Cassiodorus, was not adopted till some years
after the death of Theodoric. Consequently, 500 a.d. would be
known in Rome only as 1252 A.U.C. (from the foundation of the
City), and would have no special interest attaching to it.</blockquote>

<p>He came at an opportune time, when there was a
lull in the strife, amounting almost to civil war, caused
by a disputed Papal election. Two years before,
two bodies of clergy had met on the same day (22d.
November) in different churches, in order to elect
the successor to a deceased pope. The larger number,
assembled in the mother-church, the Lateran,
elected a deacon of Sardinian extraction, named
Symmachus. The smaller but apparently more
aristocratic body, backed by the favour of the majority
of the Senate and supported by the delegates
of the Emperor, met in the church now called by
the name of S. Maria Maggiore and voted for the
arch-presbyter Laurentius.</p>

<p>The effect of this contested election was to throw
Rome into confusion. Parties of armed men who
favoured the cause of one or the other candidate
paraded the City, and all the streets were filled with
riot and bloodshed. It seemed as if the days of
Marius and Sulla were come back again, though it
would have been impossible to explain to either
Marius or Sulla what was the nature of the contest,
a dispute as to the right to be considered successor
to a fisherman of Bethsaida. When the anarchy was
becoming intolerable, the Senate, Clergy, and People
determined to invoke the mediation of Theodoric,
thus furnishing the highest testimony to the reputation
for fairness and impartiality which had been
earned by the Arian king. Both the rival bishops
repaired to Ravenna, and having laid the case before
the king, heard his answer. "Whichsoever candidate
was first chosen, if he also received the majority of
votes, shall be deemed duly elected". Both qualifications
<a name="p232" id="p232"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 232</span>
were united in Symmachus, who was therefore
for a time recognised as lawful Pope even by Laurentius
himself.</p>

<p>The disturbances broke out again later on; charges,
probably false charges, of gross immorality were
brought against Symmachus, who fled from Rome,
returned, was tried by a Synod, and acquitted. It
was not till after nearly six years had elapsed and
six Synods had been held, that Laurentius and his
party gave up the contest and finally acquiesced in
the legitimacy of the claim of Symmachus to the
Popedom.</p>

<p>But most of these troubles were still to come:
there was a lull in the storm, and it seemed as if
the king's wise and righteous judgment had settled
the succession to the Papal chair, when in the year
500 Theodoric visited Rome, seeing for the first time,
in full middle life, the City whose name he had
doubtless often heard with a child's wonder and awe
in his father's palace by the Platten See. His first
visit was paid to the great basilica of St. Peter, outside
the walls, where he performed his devotions
with all the outward signs of reverence which would
have been exhibited by the most pious Catholic.<a id="footnotetag114" name="footnotetag114"></a>
<a href="#footnote114"><sup class="sml">114</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote114"
name="footnote114"></a><b>Footnote 114:</b><a href="#footnotetag114">
(return) </a>
Et occurrit Beato Petro devotissimus ac si Catholicus (Anon.
Valesn, 65).</blockquote>

<p>Before he entered the gates of the City he was
welcomed by the Senate and People of Rome, who
poured forth to meet him with every indication of
joy. Borne along by the jubilant throng, he reached
the Senate-house, which still stood in its majesty
overlooking the Roman Forum. Here, in some
<a name="p233" id="p233"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 233</span>
portico attached to the Senate-house, which bore
the name of the Golden Palm, he delivered an oration
to the people. The accent of the speech may
not have been faultless,<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a>
<a href="#footnote115"><sup class="sml">115</sup></a> the style was assuredly not
Ciceronian, but the matter was worthy of the enthusiastic
acclamations with which it was received. Recognising
the continuity of his government with that of
the Emperors who had preceded him, he promised
that with God's help he would keep inviolate all that
the Roman Princes in the past had ordained for
their people. So might a Norman or Angevin king,
anxious to re-assure his Saxon subjects, swear to
observe all the laws of the good King Edward the
Confessor.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote115"
name="footnote115"></a><b>Footnote 115:</b><a href="#footnotetag115">
(return) </a>
It is possible that historians somewhat underrate the degree of
Theodoric's acquaintance with Latin as a spoken language. There
was a great deal of Latin used in the Pannonian and Mesian regions,
in which his childhood and youth were passed; and some,
though certainly not so much, at Constantinople, where he spent his
boyhood.</blockquote>

<p>This speech of Theodoric's at the Golden Palm
was listened to by an obscure African monk, whose
emotions on the occasion are described to us by his
biographer. Fulgentius, the grandson of a senator
of Carthage, had forsaken what seemed a promising
official career, and had accepted the solitude and
the hardships of a monastic life, at a time when,
owing to the severe persecution of the Catholics by
the Vandal kings, there was no prospect of anything
but ignominy, exile, and perhaps death for every eminent
confessor of the Catholic faith. Fulgentius and
his friends had suffered many outrages at the hands
<a name="p234" id="p234"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 234</span>
of Numidian freebooters and Vandal officers, and
they meditated a flight into Egypt, where they
might practise a yet more rigid monastic rule undisturbed
by the civil power. In his search after a
suitable resting-place for his community, Fulgentius,
who was in the thirty-third year of his age, had
visited Sicily, and now had reached Rome in this
same summer of 500, which was made memorable
by Theodoric's visit. "He found", we are told, "the
greatest joy in this City, truly called 'the head of
the world,' both the Senate and People of Rome
testifying their gladness at the presence of Theodoric
the King. Wherefore the blessed Fulgentius, to
whom the world had long been crucified, after he
had visited with reverence the shrines of the martyrs
and saluted with humble deference as many of the
servants of God as he could in so short a time be introduced
to, stood in that place which is called Palma
Aurea while Theodoric was making his harangue.
There, as he gazed upon the nobles of the Roman
Senate marshalled in their various ranks and adorned
with comely dignity, and as he heard with chaste ears
the favouring shouts of the people, he had a chance
of knowing what the boastful pomp of this world
resembles. Yet he looked not willingly upon aught
in this gorgeous spectacle, nor was his heart seduced
to take any pleasure in these worldly vanities, but
rather kindled thereby to a more vehement desire
for Jerusalem above. And thus with edifying discourse
did he ever admonish the brethren who were
present: 'How fair must be that heavenly Jerusalem,
if the earthly Rome be thus magnificent! And
<a name="p235" id="p235"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 235</span>
if in this world such honour is paid to the lovers of
vanity, what honour and glory shall be bestowed on
the Saints who behold the Eternal Reality.' With
many such words as these did the blessed Fulgentius
debate with them in a profitable manner all
that day, and now with his whole heart earnestly
desiring to behold his monastery again, he sailed
swiftly to Africa, touching at Sardinia, and presented
himself to his monks, who, in the excess of
their joy, could scarcely believe that the blessed
Fulgentius was indeed returned".</p>

<p>Besides his promises of good government according
to the old laws of Empire, Theodoric recognised
the duty which, according to long-established usage,
devolved upon the supreme ruler to provide "panem
et circenses"<a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a>
<a href="#footnote116"><sup class="sml">116</sup></a> for the citizens of Rome. The elaborate
machinery, part of the crowned Socialism of
the Empire, by which a certain number of loaves of
bread had been distributed to the poorer householders
of the City, had probably broken down in the
death-agony of the Cæsars of the West, and had not
been again set going by Odovacar. We are told that
Theodoric now distributed as rations "to the people
of Rome and to the poor" 120,000 <i>modii</i> of corn
yearly. As this represents only 30,000 bushels,
and as in the flourishing days of the Empire no
fewer than 200,000 citizens used to present themselves,
probably once or twice a week, to receive
their rations, it is evident that (if the chronicler's
numbers are correct) we have here no attempt to revive
the wholesale distribution of corn to the citizens--an
<a name="p236" id="p236"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 236</span>
expenditure with which the finances of Theodoric's
kingdom were probably quite unable to cope.
What was now done was more strictly a measure of
"out-door relief" for the absolutely destitute classes,
and was therefore a more legitimate employment of
the energies of the State than the socialistic attempt
to feed a whole people,which had preceded it.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote116"
name="footnote116"></a><b>Footnote 116:</b><a href="#footnotetag116">
(return) </a> Bread and circus-shows.</blockquote>

<p>At the same time that he granted these <i>annonæ,</i>
Theodoric also set aside, from the proceeds of a certain
wine-tax, two hundred pounds of gold (Â£8,000) yearly
for the restoration of the Imperial dwellings on the
Palatine, and for the repair of the walls of Rome.
Little did he foresee that a time would come when
those walls, battered and breached as they were,
would be all too strong for the fortunes of the Gothic
warriors who would dash themselves vainly against
their ramparts.</p>

<p>It was now thirty years since Theodoric, returning
from his exile at Constantinople, had been hailed by
his Gothic countrymen as a partner of his father's
throne. In memory of that event, from which he
was separated by so many years of toil and triumph,
so many battles, so many marches, so many
weary negotiations with emperors and kings, Theodoric
celebrated his Tricennalia at Rome. On this
occasion the gigantic Flavian Amphitheatre--the
Colosseum as we generally call it--seems not to
have been opened to the people. The old murderous
fights with gladiators which once dyed its pavement
with human blood had been for a century
suppressed by the influence of the Church, and the
costly shows of wild beasts which were the permitted
<a name="p237" id="p237"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 237</span>
substitute would perhaps have taxed too heavily the
still feeble finances of the State. But to the Circus
Maximus all the citizens crowded in order to see the
chariot-races which were run there, and which recalled
the brilliant festivities of the Empire. The
Circus, oval in form, notwithstanding its name, was
situated in the long valley between the Palatine and
Aventine Hills. High above, on the north-east, rose
the palaces of the Cæsars already mouldering to decay,
but one of which had probably been furbished
up to make it a fitting residence for the king of the
Goths and Romans. On the south-west the solemn
Aventme still perhaps showed side by side the decaying
temples of the gods and the mansions of the
holy Roman matrons who, under the preaching of
St. Jerome, had made their sumptuous palaces the
homes of monastic self-denial. In the long ellipse
between the two hills the citizens of Rome were
ranged, not too many now in the dwindled state of
the City to find elbow-room for all. A shout of applause
went up from senators and people as the
Gothic king, surrounded by a brilliant throng of
courtiers, moved majestically to his seat in the Imperial
<i>podium.</i></p>

<p>At one end of the Circus were twelve portals
(ostia), behind which the eager charioteers were waiting.
In the middle of it there rose the long platform
called the <i>spina,</i> at either end of which stood
an obelisk brought from Egypt by an Emperor.
(One of these obelisks now adorns the Piazza del
Popolo, and the other the square in front of the
Lateran.) At a signal from the king the races began.
<a name="p238" id="p238"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 238</span>
Whether the first heat would be between
bigæ or quadrigæ (two-horse or four-horse chariots),
we cannot say; but, of one kind or the other, twelve
chariots bounded forth from the <i>ostia</i> the moment
that the rope which had hitherto confined them was
let fall. Seven times they careered round and round
the long <i>spina,</i> of course with eager struggles to get
the inside turn, and perhaps with a not infrequent
fall when a too eager charioteer, in his desire to accomplish
this, struck against the protecting curbstone.
Ac each circuit was completed by the
foremost chariot, a steward of the races placed a
great wooden egg in a conspicuous place upon the
<i>spina</i> to mark the score; and keen was the excitement
when, in a match between two well-known
rivals, six eggs announced to the spectators that the
seventh, the deciding circuit, had begun. The entire
course thus traversed seven times in each direction
made a race of between three and four miles,
and each heat would probably occupy nearly a quarter
of an hour.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a>
<a href="#footnote117"><sup class="sml">117</sup></a> The number of heats <i>(missus)</i> was usually four and twenty, and we may therefore imagine
Theodoric and his people occupying the best
part of a summer day in watching the galloping
steeds, the shouting, lashing drivers, and the fast-flashing
chariot wheels.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote117"
name="footnote117"></a><b>Footnote 117:</b><a href="#footnotetag117">
(return) </a> I take this calculation from Friedlander (Sittengeschichte Roms,
II., 329), but I cannot find the precise figures on which he bases his calculation We know the length of the Circus, but of course for our purpose the length of the <i>spina</i> round which the chariots careered is the important factor.</blockquote>

<p>At Rome, as at Constantinople, though not in
quite so exaggerated a degree, partisanship with the
<a name="p239" id="p239"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 239</span>
charioteers was more than a passing fancy; it was a
deep and abiding passion with the multitude, and it
sometimes went very near to actual madness. Four
colours, the Blue and the Green, the White and the
Red, were worn respectively by the drivers, who
served each of the four joint-stock companies (as we
should call them) that catered for the taste of the
race-loving multitude. Red and White had had
their day of glory and still won a fair proportion of
races, but the keenest and most terrible competition
was between Blue and Green. At Constantinople, a
generation later than the time which we have now
reached, the undue favour which an Emperor (Justinian.)
was accused (532) of showing to the Blues
caused an insurrection which wrapped the city in
flames and nearly cost that Emperor his throne.
No such disastrous consequences resulted from circus-partisanship
in Rome: but even in Rome that
partisanship was very bitter, and, in the view of a
philosopher, supremely ridiculous. As the sage
Cassiodorus remarked: "In these beyond all other
shows, men's minds are hurried into excitement,
without any regard to a fitting sobriety of character.
The Green charioteer flashes by: part of the people
is in despair. The Blue gets a lead: a larger part of
the City is in misery. The populace cheer frantically
when they have gained nothing; they are cut to the
heart when they have received no loss; and they
plunge with as much eagerness into these empty
contests as if the whole welfare of their imperilled
country depended upon them". In two other letters
<a name="p240" id="p240"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 240</span>
Theodoric is obliged seriously to chide the Roman
Senate for its irascible temper in dealing with one
of the factions of the Circus. A Patrician and a
Consul, so it was alleged, had truculently assaulted
the Green party, and one man had lost his life in the
fray. The king ordered that the matter should be
enquired into by two officials of "Illustrious" rank,
who had special jurisdiction in cases wherein nobles
of high position were concerned. He then replied to
a counter-accusation which had been brought by the
Senators against the mob for assailing them with
rude clamours in the Hippodrome. "You must distinguish",
says the king, "between deliberate insolence
and the festive impertinences of a place of
public amusement. It is not exactly a congregation
of Catos that comes together at the Circus. The
place excuses some excesses. And moreover you
must remember that these insulting cries generally
proceed from the beaten party: and therefore you
need not complain of clamour which is the result of
a victory that you earnestly desired". Again the
king had to warn the Senators not to bring disgrace
on their good name and do violence to public order
by allowing their menials to embroil themselves with
the mob of the Hippodrome. Any slave accused of
having shed the blood of a free-born citizen was to
be at once given up to justice; or else his master was
to pay a fine of £400, and to incur the severe displeasure
of the king. "And do not you, O Senators,
be too strict in marking every idle word which
the mob may utter in the midst of the general
rejoicing. If any insult which requires special notice
<a name="p241" id="p241"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 241</span>
should be offered you, bring it before the Prefect
of the City. This is far wiser and safer than taking
the law into your own hands".</p>

<p>The festivities which celebrated Theodoric's visit
to the Eternal City were perhaps somewhat discordantly
interrupted by the discovery of a conspiracy
against him, set on foot by a certain Count Odoin,
about whom we have no other information, but the
form of whose name at once suggests that he was of
Gothic, not Roman, extraction. It is possible that
this conspiracy indicates the discontent of the old
Gothic nobility with the increasing tendency to copy
Roman civilisation and to assume Imperial prerogatives
which they observed in the king who had once
been little more than chief among a band of comrades.
But we have not sufficient information as to this conspiracy
to enable us to fix its true place in the history
of Theodoric, nor can we even say with confidence
that it was directed against the king and not against
one of his ministers. The result alone is certain.
Odoin's treachery was discovered and he was beheaded
in the Sessorian palace, a building which
probably stood upon the patrimony of Constantine,
hard by the southern wall of Rome, and near to the
spot where we now see the Church of Santa Croce.</p>

<p>At the request of the people, the words of Theodoric's
harangue on his entrance into the City were
engraved on a brazen tablet, which was fixed in a
place of public resort, perhaps the Roman Forum.
Even so did the <i>Joyeuse Entrée</i> of a Burgundian
duke into Brussels confirm and commemorate the
privileges of his good subjects the citizens of Brabant.
<a name="p242" id="p242"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 242</span>
Upon the whole, there can be little doubt
that the half-year which Theodoric spent in Rome
was really a time of joyfulness both to prince and
people, and that the tiles which are still occasionally
turned up by the spade in Rome, bearing the inscription
"Domino Nostro Theodorico Felix Roma",
were not merely the work of official flatterers, but
did truly express the joy of a well-governed nation.
After six months Theodoric returned to that city,
which, during the last thirty years of his life, he
probably regarded as his home--Ravenna by the
Adriatic,--and there he delighted the heart of his
subjects by the pageants which celebrated the marriage
of his niece Amalaberga with Hermanfrid, the
king of the distant Thuringians. This young prince,
whom Theodoric had adopted as his "son by right
of arms" <a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a>
<a href="#footnote118"><sup class="sml">118</sup></a> had sent to his future kinsman a team of cream-coloured horses of a rare breed,<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a>
<a href="#footnote119"><sup class="sml">119</sup></a>
and Theodoric sent in return horses, swords and shields, and
<a name="p243" id="p243"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 243</span>
other instruments of war, but, as he said, "the
greatest requital that we make is joining you in
marriage to a woman of such surpassing beauty as
our niece".</p>

Their chests and thighs are adorned in a becoming manner with spheres of flesh. Their ribs are expanded to a certain breadth; their bellies are short and narrow. Their heads have a likeness to the stag's, and they imitate the swiftness of that animal. These horses are gentle from their extreme plumpness; very swift, for all their bigness, pleasant to look upon, yet more pleasant to ride. For they have gentle paces and do not fatigue their riders with insane curvetings. To ride them is rest rather than labour; and being broken in to a delightfully steady pace, they have great staying power and lasting activity". These sleek and easy-paced cobs are not at all the ideal present from a rough barbarian of the North to his "father in arms".</blockquote>

<p>The later fortunes of the Ostrogothic princess who
thus migrated from Ravenna to the banks of the
Elbe were not happy. A proud and ambitious
woman, she is said to have stimulated her husband
to make himself, by fratricide and civil war, sole king
of the Thuringians. The help of one of the sons of
Clovis had been unwisely invoked for this operation.
So long as the Ostrogothic hero lived, Thuringia was
safe under his protection, but soon after his death
dissensions arose between Franks and Thuringians;
a claim of payment was made for the ill-requited
services of the former. Thuringia was invaded, (531) her
king defeated, and after a while treacherously
slain. Amalaberga took refuge with her kindred
at Ravenna, and after the collapse of their
fortunes retired to Constantinople, where her son
entered the Imperial service. In after years that
son, "Amalafrid the Goth", was not the least famous
of the generals of Justinian. The broad lands
between the Elbe and the Danube, over which
the Thuringians had wandered, were added to the
dominions of the Franks and became part of the
mighty kingdom of Austrasia.</p>

<p>I have had occasion many times in the preceding
pages to write the name of Ravenna, the residence
of most of the sovereigns of the sinking Empire, and
now the home of Theodoric. Let me attempt in a
few paragraphs to give some faint idea of the impression
<a name="p244" id="p244"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 2445</span>
which this city, a boulder-stone left by the icedrift
of the dissolving Empire amid the green fields
of modern civilisation, produces on the mind of a
traveller.</p>

<p>Ravenna stands in a great alluvial plain between
the Apennines, the Adriatic, and the Po. The fine
mud, which has been for centuries poured over the
land by the streams descending from the mountains,
has now silted up her harbour, and Classis, the maritime
suburb of Ravenna, which, in the days of
Odovacar and Theodoric, was a busy sea port on the
Adriatic, now consists of one desolate church--magnificent
in its desolation--and two or three farm-buildings
standing in the midst of a lonely and fever-haunted
rice-swamp. Between the city and the sea
stretches for miles the glorious pine-forest, now alas!
cruelly maimed by the hands of Nature and of Man,
by the frost of one severe winter and by the spades
of the builders of a railway, but still preserving some
traces of its ancient beauty. Here it was that Theodoric
pitched his camp when for three weary years
he blockaded his rival's last stronghold, and here by
the deep trench (<i>fossatum</i>), which he had dug to
guard that camp, he fought the last and not the
least deadly of his fights, when Odovacar made his
desperate sortie from the famine-stricken town.
Memories of a gentler kind, but still not wanting in
sadness, now cluster round the solemn avenues of
the Pineta. There we still seem to see Dante
wandering, framing his lay of the "selva oscura",
through which lay his path to the unseen world, and
ever looking in vain for the arrival of the messenger
<a name="p245" id="p245"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 245</span>
who should summon him back to ungrateful Florence.
There, in Boccaccio's story, a maiden's hapless ghost
is for ever pursued through the woods by "the spectre-huntsman",
Guido Cavalcanti, whom her cruelty had
driven to suicide. And there, in our fathers' days,
rode Byron, like Dante, an exile, if self-exiled, from
his country, and feeding on bitter remembrances
of past praise and present blame, both too lightly
bestowed by his countrymen.</p>

<p>We leave the pine-wood and the desolate-looking
rice-fields, we cross over the sluggish streams--Ronco
and Montone--and we stand in the streets of historic
Ravenna. Our first thoughts are all of disappointment.
There is none of the trim beauty of a modern
city, nor, as we at first think, is there any of the endless
picturesqueness of a well-preserved mediæval
city. We look in vain for any building like Giotto's
Campanile at Florence, for any space like that noble,
crescent-shaped Forum, full of memories of the
Middle Ages, the Piazzo del Campo of Siena. We
see some strange but not altogether beautiful bell-towers
and one or two brown cupolas breaking the
sky-line, but that seems to be all, and our first feeling
as I have said, is one of disappointment. But when
we enter the churches, if we have leisure to study,
them, if we can let their spirit mingle with our
spirits, if we can quietly ask them what they have to
tell us of the Past, all disappointment vanishes. For
Ravenna is to those who will study her attentively a
very Pompeii of the fifth century, telling us as much
concerning those years of the falling Empire and the
rising Mediæval Church as Pompeii can tell us of the
<a name="p246" id="p246"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 246</span>
social life of the Romans in the days of triumphant
Paganism.</p>

<p>Not that the record is by any means perfect.
Many leaves have been torn out of the book by the
childish conceit of recent centuries, which vainly
imagined that they could write something instead,
which any mortal would now care to read. The destroying
hand of the so-called <i>Renaissance</i> has passed
over these churches, defacing sometimes the chancel,
sometimes the nave. One of the most interesting of
the churches of Ravenna<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a>
<a href="#footnote120"><sup class="sml">120</sup></a> has "the cupola disfigured
by wretched paintings which mislead the eye in following
the lines of the building". Another<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a>
<a href="#footnote121"><sup class="sml">121</sup></a> has its
apse covered with those gilt spangles and clouds
and cherubs which were the eighteenth century's
ideal of impressive religious art. The Duomo, which
should have been one of the mosf interesting of all
the monuments of Ravenna, was almost entirely rebuilt
in the last century, and is now scarcely worth
visiting. Still, enough remains in the un-restored
churches of Ravenna to captivate the attention of
every student of history and every lover of early
Christian art. It is only necessary to shut our eyes
to the vapid and tasteless work of recent embellishers,
as we should close our ears to the whispers of
vulgar gossipers while listening to some noble and
entrancing piece of sacred music.</p>

<p>Thus concentrating our attention on that which is
really interesting and venerable in these churches,
<a name="p247" id="p247"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 247</span>
while we admire their long colonnades, their skilful
use of ancient columns--some of which may probably
have adorned the temples of Olympian deities in the
days of the Emperors,--and the exceedingly rich and
beautiful new forms of capitals, of a design quite unknown
to Vitruvius, which the genius of Romanesque
artists has invented, we find that our chief interest
is derived from the mosaics with which these churches
were once so lavishly adorned. Mosaic, as is well-known,
is the most permanent of all the processes of
decorative art. Fresco must fade sooner or later, and
where there is any tendency to damp, it fades with
cruel rapidity. Oil painting on canvas changes its
tone in the long course of years, and the boundary
line between cleaning and repainting is difficult to
observe. But the fragments out of which the mosaic
picture is formed, having been already passed through
the fire, will keep their colour for centuries, we might
probably say for millenniums. Damp injures them
not, except by lessening the cement with which they
are fastened to the wall, and therefore when restore
tion of a mosaic picture becomes necessary, a really
conscientious restorer can always reproduce the picture
with precisely the same form and colour which
it had when the last stone was inserted by the original
artist. And thus, when we visit Ravenna, we
have the satisfaction of feeling that we are (in many
cases) looking upon the very same picture which was
gazed upon by the contemporaries of Theodoric.
Portraits of Theodoric himself, unfortunately we
have none; but we have two absolutely contemporary
portraits of Justinian, the overturner of his
<a name="p248" id="p248"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 248</span>
kingdom, and one of Justinian's wife, the celebrated
Theodora. These pictures, it is interesting to remember,
were considerably older when Cimabue
found Giotto in the sheepfolds drawing sheep upon
a tile, than any picture of Cimabue's or Giotto's is at
the present time.</p>

<p>Let us enter the church which is now called "S.
Apollinare within the Walls", but which in the time
of Theodoric was called the Church of S. Martin,
often with the addition "de Cælo Aureo", on account
of the beautiful gilded ceiling which distinguished
it from the other basilicas of Ravenna. This
church was built by order of Theodoric, who apparently
intended it to be his own royal chapel. Probably,
therefore, the great Ostrogoth many a time
saw "the Divine mysteries" celebrated here by
bishops and priests of the Arian communion. Two
long colonnades fill the nave of the church. The
columns are classical, with Corinthian capitals, and
are perhaps brought from some older building. A
peculiarity of the architecture consists in the high
abacus--a frustum of an inverted pyramid--which
is interposed between the capital of the column and
the arch that springs from it, as if to give greater
height than the columns alone would afford. Such
in its main features was the Church of "St. Martin
of the Golden Heaven", when Theodoric worshipped
under its gorgeous roof. But its chief adornment,
the feature which makes more impression on the beholder
than anything else in Ravenna, was added
after Theodoric's death, yet not so long after but
that it may be suitably alluded to here as a specimen
<a name="p249" id="p249"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 249</span>
of the style of decoration which his eyes must have
been wont to look upon. About the year 560, after
the downfall of the Gothic monarchy, Agnellus, the
Catholic Bishop of Ravenna, "reconciled" this
church, that is, re-consecrated it for the performance
of worship by orthodox priests, and in doing so
adorned the attics of the nave immediately above
the colonnades with two remarkable mosaic friezes,
each representing a long procession.</p>

<p>On the north wall of the church we behold a procession
of Virgin Martyrs. They are twenty-four
in number, a little larger than life, and are chiefly
those maidens who suffered in the terrible persecution
of Diocletian. The place from which they start
is a seaport town with ships entering the harbour,
domes and columns and arcades showing over the
walls of the city. An inscription tells us that we
have here represented the city of Classis, the seaport
of Ravenna. By the time that we have reached
the last figure in this long procession we are almost
at the east end of the nave. Here we see the Virgin-mother
throned in glory with the infant Jesus on her
lap, and two angels on each side of her. But between
the procession and the throne is interposed the
group of the three Wise Men, in bright-coloured
raiment, with tiara-like crowns upon their heads,
stooping forward as if with eager haste<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a>
<a href="#footnote122"><sup class="sml">122</sup></a> to present
their various oblations to the Divine Child.</p>

</div></div>

</blockquote>

<a name="p250" id="p250"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 250</span>

<p>On the right, or south wall of the church, a similar
procession of martyred men, twenty-six in number,
seems to move along, in all the majesty of suffering,
bearing their crowns of martyrdom as offerings to
the Redeemer. The Christ is here not an infant
but a full-grown man, the Man of Sorrows, His head
encircled with a nimbus, and two angels are standing
on either side. The martyr-procession starts from a
building, with pediment above and three arches resting
upon pillars below. The intervals between the
pillars are partly filled with curtains looped up in a
curious fashion and with bright purple spots upon
them. An inscription on this building tells us that
it is PALATIUM, that is Theodoric's palace at Ravenna.</p>

<p>In both these processions the representation is, of
course, far from the perfection of Art. Both the
faces and the figures have a certain stiffness, partly
due to the very nature of mosaic-work. There is also
a sort of child-like simplicity in the treatment, especially
of the female figures, which an unsympathetic
critic would call grotesque. But, I think, most beholders
feel that there is something indescribably
solemn in these two great mosaic pictures in S.
Apollinare Dentro. From the glaring, commonplace
Italian town with its police-notices and its
proclamation of the number of votes given to the
government of Vittorio Emmanuele, you step into
the grateful shade of the church and find yourself
transported into the sixth century after Christ. You
are looking on the faces of the men and maidens
who suffered death with torture rather than deny
<a name="p251" id="p251"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 251</span>
their Lord. For thirteen centuries those two processions
have seemed to be moving on upon the
walls of the basilica, and another ceaseless procession
of worshippers, Goths, Byzantines, Lombards,
Franks, Italians, has been in reality moving on beneath
them to the grave. And then you remind
yourself that when the artist sketched those figures
on the walls, he was separated by no longer interval
than three long lives would have bridged over, from
the days of the persecution itself, that there were
still men living on the earth who worshipped the
Olympian Jupiter, and that the name of Mohammed,
son of Abdallah, was unknown in the world.
So, as you gaze, the telescope of the historic
imagination does its work, and the far-off centuries
become near.</p>

<p>One or two other Arian churches built during
Theodoric's reign in the northern suburb of the
city have now entirely disappeared. There still
remains, however, the church which Theodoric
seems to have built as the cathedral of the Arian
community, while leaving the old metropolitan
church (Ecclesia Ursiana, now the Duomo) as the
cathedral of the Catholics. This Arian cathedral
was dedicated to St. Theodore, but has in later ages
been better known as the church of the Holy
Spirit. Tasteless restoration has robbed it of the
mosaics which it doubtless once possessed, but it
has preserved its fine colonnade consisting of fourteen
columns of dark green marble with Corinthian
capitals, whose somewhat unequal height seems to
show that they, like so many of their sisters, have
<a name="p252" id="p252"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 252</span>
been brought from some other building, where they
have once perhaps served other gods.</p>

<p>Through the court-yard of the Church of San
Spirito, we approach a little octagonal building
known both as the Oratory of S. Maria in Cosmedia
and as the Arian Baptistery. The great octagonal
font, which once stood in the centre of the building,
has disappeared, but we can easily reconstruct it in
our imaginations from the similar one which still
remains in the Catholic Baptistery. The interest of
this building consists in the mosaics of its cupola.
On the disk, in the centre, is represented the Baptism
of Christ. The Saviour stands, immersed up
to His loins, in the Jordan, whose water flowing past
Him is depicted with a quaint realism. The Baptist
stands on His left side and holds one hand over
His head. On the right of the Saviour stands an
old man, who is generally said to represent the River-god,
and the reed in his hand, the urn, from which
water gushes, under his arms, certainly seem to
favour this supposition. But in order to avoid so
strange a medley of Christianity and heathenism it
has been suggested that the figure may be meant
for Moses, and in confirmation of this theory some
keen-eyed beholders have thought they perceived
the symbolical horned rays proceeding from each
side of the old man's forehead.</p>

<p>Round this central disk are seen the figures of
the twelve Apostles. They are divided into two
bands of six each, who seem marching, with crowns
in their hands, towards a throne covered with a veil
and a cushion, on which rests a cross blazing with
jewels. St. Peter stands on the right of the throne,
<a name="p253" id="p253"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 253</span>
St. Paul on the left; and these two Apostles carry
instead of crowns, the one the usual keys, and the
other two rolls of parchment. The interest of these
figures, though they have something of the stern
majesty of early mosaic-work, is somewhat lessened
by the fact that they have undergone considerable
restoration. It is suggested, I know not whether
on sufficient grounds, that the figures of the Apostles
were added when the Baptistery was "reconciled" to the Catholic worship after the overthrow
of the Gothic dominion.</p>

<p>Two more buildings at Ravenna which are connected
with the name of Theodoric require to be
noticed by us,--his Palace and his Tomb. The
story of his Tomb, however, will be best told when
his reign is ended. As for the Palace, which once
occupied a large space in the eastern quarter of the
city, we have seen that there is a representation of
it in mosaic on the walls of S. Apollinare Dentro.
Closely adjoining that church, and facing the modern
Corso Garibaldi, is a wall about five and twenty
feet high, built of square brick-tiles, which has in its
upper storey one large and six small arched recesses,
the arches resting on columns. Only the front is
ancient--it is admitted that the building behind it is
modern. Low down in the wall, so low that the
citizens of Ravenna, in passing, brush it with their
sleeves, is a bath-shaped vessel of porphyry, which
in the days of archaeological ignorance used to be
shown to strangers as "the coffin of Theodoric", but
the fact is that its history and its purpose are entirely
unknown.</p>

<p>This shell of a building is called in the Ravenna
<a name="p254" id="p254"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 254</span>
Guide-books "the Palace of Theodoric". Experts
are not yet agreed on the question whether its architectural
features justify us in referring it to the sixth
century, though all agree that it does not belong
to a much later age.<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a>
<a href="#footnote123"><sup class="sml">123</sup></a> It does not agree with the
representation of the <i>Palatium</i> in the Church of S.
Apollinare Dentro, and if it have anything whatever
to do with it, it is probably not the main front, nor
even any very important feature of the spacious
palace, which, as we are told by the local historians,<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a>
<a href="#footnote124"><sup class="sml">124</sup></a> and learn
from inscriptions, was surrounded with
porticoes, adorned with the most precious mosaics,
divided into several <i>triclinia</i>, surmounted by a tower
which was considered one of the most magnificent
of the king's buildings, and surrounded with pleasant
and fruitful gardens, planted on ground which
had been reclaimed from the morass.<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a>
<a href="#footnote125"><sup class="sml">125</sup></a> But practically
almost all the monuments of the Ostrogothic
<a name="p255" id="p255"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 255</span>
hero except his tomb and the three churches already
described, have vanished from Ravenna. Would
that we could have seen the great mosaic which
once adorned the pediment of his palace. There
Theodoric stood, clad in mail, with spear and shield.
On his left was a female figure representing the
City of Rome, also with a spear in her hand and her
head armed with a helmet, while towards his right
Ravenna seemed speeding with one foot on the land
and the other on the sea. How this great mosaic
perished is not made clear to us. But there was also an
equestrian statue of Theodoric raised on a pyramid
six cubits high. Horse and rider were both of brass,
"covered with yellow gold", and the king here too
had his buckler on his left arm, while the right,
extended, pointed a lance at an invisible foe.</p>

Theodoric's heir--Pope and Emperor reconciled--Anti-Jewish
riot at Ravenna--Strained relations of Theodoric and his Catholic

<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/043a.png">ithero the career of Theodoric
has been one of almost unbroken
prosperity, and the reader who has
followed his history has perhaps
grown somewhat weary of the monotonous
repetition of the praises
of his mildness and his equity. Unfortunately
he will be thus wearied
no longer. The sun of the great
Ostrogoth set in sorrow, and what was worse than in
sorrow, in deeds of hasty wrath and cruel injustice,
<a name="p257" id="p257"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 257</span>
which lost him the hearts of the majority of his subjects
and which have dimmed his fair fame with
posterity.</p>

<p>Many causes combined to sadden and depress the
king's heart, as he felt old age creeping upon him.
Providence had not blessed him with a son; and
while his younger rival, Clovis, left four martial sons
to defend (and also to partition) his newly formed
kingdom, Theodoric's daughter Amalasuentha was
the only child born of his marriage with Clovis'
sister.</p>

<p>In order to provide himself with a male heir (for
the customs of the Goths did not favour, if they did
not actually exclude, female sovereignty), Theodoric
summoned to his court a distant relative, a young
man named Eutharic, descended from the mighty
Hermanric, who was at the time living in Spain.
Eutharic, who was well reported of for bodily vigour
and for statesmanlike ability, came to the
Ostrogothic court, married Amalasuentha (515),
four years afterwards received the honour of a consulship,
which he held along with the Emperor
Justin, and exhibited games and combats of wild
beasts to the populace of Rome and Ravenna on a
scale of unsurpassed magnificence. But he died,
probably soon after his consulship, leaving two children--a
boy and a girl,--and thus Theodoric's hope
of bequeathing his crown to a mature and masculine
heir was disappointed. Still, however, he would not
propose a female ruler to his old Gothic comrades;
and the little grandson, Athalaric, though under ten
years of age, was solemnly presented by him to an
<a name="p258" id="p258"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 258</span>
assembly of Gothic counts and the nobles of the
nation as their king.</p>

<p>The proclamation of Athalaric was made when the
king felt that he should shortly depart this life,
probably in the summer of 526. I have mentioned
it here in order to complete my statement as to the
succession to the throne, but we will now return to
an earlier period-to the events which immediately
followed Eutharic's consulship. Coming as he did
from Spain, the Visigothic lords of which were still
an aristocracy of bitter Arians in the midst of a
cowed but Catholic Roman population, Eutharic,
who, as we are expressly told, "was too harsh and
hostile to the Catholic faith", may have to some extent
swayed the mind of his father-in-law away from
its calm balance of even-handed justice between the
rival Churches. But the state of affairs at Constantinople
exercised a yet more powerful influence.
Anastasius, who, though no Arian, had during his
long reign been always in an attitude of hostility
towards the Papal See, was now dead, and had been
succeeded by Justin. This man, a soldier of fortune,
who had as a lad tramped down from the Macedonian
highlands into the capital, with a wallet of biscuit
over his shoulder for his only property, had risen, by
his soldierly qualities, to the position of Count of the
Guardsmen, and by a judicious distribution of gold
among the soldiers--gold which was not his own, but
had been entrusted to him for safe-keeping,--he won
for himself the diadem, and for his nephew,<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a>
<a href="#footnote126"><sup class="sml">126</sup></a> as it
turned out, the opportunity of making his name
<a name="p259" id="p259"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 259</span>
forever memorable in history. Justin was absolutely
illiterate--the story about the stencilled signature is
told of him as well as of Theodoric,--but he was
strictly orthodox, and his heart was set on a reconciliation
with the Roman See. This measure was
also viewed with favour by the majority of the
populace of Constantinople, with whom the heterodoxy
of Anastasius had become decidedly unpopular.
Thus the negotiations for a settlement of the
dispute went prosperously forward. The anathemas
which were insisted upon by the Roman pontiff were
soon conceded, the names of Zeno, of Anastasius, and
of five Patriarchs of Constantinople who had dared
to dissent from the Roman See were struck out of
the "Diptychs" (or lists of those men, living or dead,
whom the Church regarded as belonging to her communion);
and thus the first great schism between the
Eastern and Western Churches--a schism which had
lasted for thirty-five years--was ended.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote126"
name="footnote126"></a><b>Footnote 126:</b><a href="#footnotetag126">

<p>It was probably foreseen by the statesmen of Ravenna
that this reconciliation between Pope and Emperor,
a reconciliation which had been celebrated by
the enthusiastic shout of the multitude in the great
church of the Divine Wisdom at Constantinople,
would sooner or later bring trouble to Theodoric's
Arian fellow-worshippers. In point of fact, however,
an interval of nearly six years elapsed before
any actual persecution of the Arians of the Empire
was attempted. The first cause of alienation
between the Ostrogothic king and his Catholic subjects
seems to have arisen in connection with the
Jews. Theodoric, on account of some fear of invasion
<a name="p260" id="p260"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 260</span>
 by the barbarians beyond the Alps, was dwelling
at Verona. That city, the scene of his most
desperate battle with Odovacar, commanding as it
does the valley of the Adige and the road by the
Brenner Pass into the Tyrol, was probably looked
upon by Theodoric as the key of north-eastern
Italy, and when there was any danger of invasion he
preferred to hold his court there rather than in the
safer but less convenient Ravenna. There too he
may probably have often received the ambassadors
of the Northern nations, who went back to their
homes with those stories of the might and majesty of
the Ostrogothic king which made "Dietrich of Bern"
(Theodoric of Verona) a name of wonder and a
theme of romance to many generations of German
minstrels. While Theodoric was dwelling in the
city of the Adige, tidings came to him, apparently
from his son-in-law Eutharic, whom he had left in
charge at Ravenna, that the whole city was in an
uproar. The Jews, of whom there was evidently
a considerable number, were accused of having made
sport of the Christian rite of baptism by throwing
one another into one of the two muddy rivers
of Ravenna, and also, in some way not described to
us, to have mocked at the supper of the Lord.<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a>
<a href="#footnote127"><sup class="sml">127</sup></a> The
Christian populace of the city were excited to such
madness by these rumours that they broke out into
rioting, which neither the Gothic vicegerent, Eutharic,
nor their own bishop, Peter III., was able to quell,
and which did not cease till all the Jewish synagogues
of the city were laid in ashes.</p>

name="footnote127"></a><b>Footnote 127:</b><a href="#footnotetag127">
(return) </a>
The passage of the "Anonymus Valesii" which describes these
events is so corrupt that it is hardly possible to make sense of it.</blockquote>

<a name="p261" id="p261"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 261</span>

<p>When tidings of these events were brought to
Verona by the Grand Chamberlain Triwan (or Trigguilla)
who, as an Arian, was suspected of favouring
the Jews, and when the Hebrews came themselves to
invoke the justice of the King, Theodoric's righteous
indignation was kindled against these flagrant violations
of <i>civilitas</i>. It was not, indeed, the first time
that his intervention had been claimed on behalf of
the persecuted children of Israel. At Milan and at
Genoa they had already appealed to him against the
vexations of their neighbours, and at Rome the mob,
excited by some idle story of harsh punishments
inflicted by the Jews on their Christian servants, had
burned their synagogue in the Trastevere to the
ground. The protection claimed had always been
freely conceded. Theodoric, while expressing or
permitting Cassiodorus to express his pious wonder
that a race which wilfully shut itself out from the
eternal rest of Heaven should care for quietness on
earth, was strong in declaring that for the sake of
<i>civilitas</i> justice was to be secured even for the wanderers
from the right religious path, and that no one
should be forced to believe in Christianity against
his will. Nor was this willingness to protect the
Jews from popular fanaticism peculiar to Theodoric.
Always, so long as the Goths, either the Western or
Eastern branch, remained Arian, the Jews found
favour in their eyes, and Jacob had rest under the
shadow of the sons of Odin. Now, therefore, the
king sent an edict addressed to Eutharic and Bishop
Peter, ordaining that a pecuniary contribution should
be levied on all the Christian citizens of Ravenna,
out of which the synagogues should be rebuilt, and
<a name="p262" id="p262"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 2621</span>
that those who were not able to pay their share of
this contribution should be flogged through the
streets, the crier going behind them and in a loud
voice proclaiming their offence. The order was
doubtless obeyed, but from that day there was a
secret spirit of rebellion in the hearts of the Roman
citizens of Ravenna.</p>

<p>From this time onward occasions of difference
between Theodoric and his Roman subjects were
frequently arising. For some reason which is not
explained to us, he ordered the Catholic church of
St. Stephen in the suburbs of Verona to be destroyed.
Then came suspicion, the child of rancour.
An order was put forth forbidding the inhabitants
of Roman origin to wear any arms, and this prohibition
extended even to pocket-knives. In the
excited state of men's minds earth and heaven
seemed to them to be full of portents..There were
earthquakes; there was a comet with a fiery tail
which blazed for fifteen days; a poor Gothic woman
lay down under a portico near Theodoric's palace at
Ravenna and gave birth (so we are assured) to four
dragons, two of which, having one head between
them, were captured, while the other two, sailing
away eastward through the clouds, were seen to fall
headlong into the sea.</p>

<p>More important than these old wives' fables was
the changed attitude and the wavering loyalty of
the Roman Senate. From the remarks made in an
earlier chapter,<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a>
<a href="#footnote128"><sup class="sml">128</sup></a> it will be clear that a conscientious Roman citizen might truly feel that he owed a
<a name="p263" id="p263"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 263</span>
divided allegiance to the Ostrogoth, his ruler <i>de
facto</i>, and to the Augustus at Constantinople, his
sovereign <i>de jure</i>. Through the years of religious
schism this conflict of duties had slumbered, but
now, with the enthusiastic reconciliation between the
see of Rome and the throne of Constantinople, it
awoke; and in that age when, as has been already
said, religion was nationality, an orthodox Eastern
emperor seemed a much more fitting object of
homage than an Arian Italian king.</p>

<p>There were two men, united by the ties of kindred,
who seemed marked out by character and position
as the leaders of a patriotic party in the Senate, if
such a party could be formed. These men were
Boëthius and his father-in-law Symmachus, both
Roman nobles of the great and ancient Anician
<i>gens</i>. Boëthius, whose name we have already met
with as the skilful mechanic who was requested to
construct a water-clock and a sun-dial for the king
of the Burgundians, was a man of great and varied
accomplishments--philosopher, theologian, musician,
and mathematician. He had translated thirty books
of Aristotle into Latin for the benefit of his countrymen;
his treatise on Music was for many centuries
the authoritative exposition of the science of
harmony. He had held the high honour of the
consulship in 510; twelve years later he had the yet
higher honour of seeing his two sons, Symmachus
and Boëthius, though mere lads, arrayed in the <i>trabea</i>
of the consul.</p>

<p>Symmachus the other leader of the patriotic party
in the Roman Senate had memories of illustrious
<a name="p264" id="p264"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 264</span>
ancestors behind him. A century before, another
Symmachus had been the standard-bearer of the old
Pagan party, and had delivered two great orations in
order to prevent the Christian Emperors from removing
the venerable Altar of Victory from the
Senate-house. Now, his descendant and namesake
was an equally firm adherent of Christianity, a friend
and counsellor of Popes, a man who was willing to
encounter obloquy and even death in behalf of
Nicene orthodoxy. He had been consul so long ago
as in the reign of Odovacar, he had been an "Illustrious"
Prefect of the City under Theodoric; he was
now Patrician and Chief of the Senate (Caput Senatus).
The last two titles conferred honour rather
than power; the headship of the Senate especially
being generally held by the oldest, and if not by the
oldest, by the most esteemed and venerated member
of that body. Such was Symmachus, a man full of
years and honours, a historian, an orator, and a generous
contributor of some portion of his vast wealth
for the adornment of his native city.</p>

<p>Boëthius, left an orphan in childhood, had enjoyed
the wise training of his guardian Symmachus. When
he came to man's estate he married that guardian's
daughter Rusticiana. Though there was the difference
of a generation between them, a close friendship
united the old and the middle-aged senators, and the
young consuls sprung from this alliance, who were
the hope of their blended lines, bore, as we have seen,
the names of both father and grandfather.</p>

<p>Up to the year 523, Boëthius appears to have enjoyed
to the full the favour of Theodoric. From a
<a name="p265" id="p265"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 265</span>
chapter of his autobiography<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a>
<a href="#footnote129"><sup class="sml">129</sup></a> we learn that he had
already often opposed the ministers of the crown
when he found them to be unjust and rapacious
men. "How often" says he, "have I met the rush of
Cunigast, when coming open-mouthed to devour the
substance of the poor! How often have I baffled
the all but completed schemes of injustice prepared
by the chamberlain Trigguilla! How often have I
interposed my influence to protect the unhappy men
whom the unpunished avarice of the barbarians was
worrying with infinite calumnies! Paulinus, a man
of consular rank, whose wealth the hungry dogs of
the palace had already devoured in fancy, I dragged
as it were out of their very jaws". But all these acts
of righteous remonstrance against official tyranny,
though from the names given they seem to have
been chiefly directed against Gothic ministers, had
not forfeited for Boëthius the favour of his sovereign.
The proof of this is furnished by the almost unexampled
honour conferred upon him--certainly with
Theodoric's consent--by the elevation of his two
sons to the consulship. The exultant father, from
his place in the Senate, expressed his thanks to
Theodoric in an oration of panegyric, which is now
no longer extant, but was considered by contemporaries
a masterpiece of brilliant rhetoric.</p>

<p>So far all had gone well with the fortunes of
Boëthius; but now, perhaps about the middle of 523,
there came a great and calamitous change. We
must revert for a few minutes to the family circumstances
of Theodoric, in order to understand the
<a name="p266" id="p266"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 266</span>
influences which were embittering his spirit against
his Catholic--that is to say, his Roman--subjects.
The year before, his grandson Segeric, the Burgundian,
had been treacherously assassinated by order of his
father, King Sigismund, who had become a convert
to the orthodox creed, and after the death of Theodoric's
daughter had married a Catholic woman of
low origin. In the year 523 itself, Thrasamund, king
of the Vandals, died and was succeeded by his cousin
Hilderic, son of one of the most ferocious persecutors
of the Catholic Church, but himself a convert to her
creed. Notwithstanding an oath which Hilderic had
sworn to his predecessor on his death-bed, never to
use his royal power for the restoration of the churches
to the Catholics, Hilderic had recalled the Bishops
of the orthodox party and was in all things reversing
the bitter persecuting policy of his ancestors,
amalafrida, the sister of Theodoric and widow of
Thrasamund, who had been for nearly twenty years
queen of the Vandals, passionately resented this undoing
of her dead husband's work and put herself at
the head of a party of insurgents, who called in the
aid of the Moorish barbarians, but who were, notwithstanding
that aid, defeated by the soldiers of
Hilderic at Capsa. Amalafrida herself was taken
captive and shut up in prison, probably about the
middle of 523.</p>

<p>Thus everywhere the Arian League, of which
Theodoric had been the head, and which had practically
given him the hegemony of Teutonic Europe,
was breaking down; and in its collapse disaster and
violent death were coming upon the members of
<a name="p267" id="p267"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 267</span>
Theodoric's own family. If Eutharic himself, as
seems probable, had died before this time, and was
no longer at the King's side to whisper distrust of
the Catholics at every step, and to put the worst construction
on the actions of every patriotic Roman,
yet even Eutharic's death increased the difficulties of
Theodoric's position, and his doubts as to the future
fortunes of a dynasty which would be represented
at his death only by a woman and a child. And
these difficulties and doubts bred in him not depression,
but an irascible and suspicious temper, which
had hitherto been altogether foreign to his calm and
noble nature.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things at the court of
Ravenna when, in the summer or early autumn of
523, Cyprian, Reporter in the King's Court, accused
the Patrician Albinus of sending letters to the Emperor
Justin hostile to the royal rule of Theodoric.
Of the character and history of Albinus, notwithstanding
his eminent station, we know but little.
He was not only Patrician, but Illustris--that is, in
modern phraseology, he had held an office of cabinet-rank.
On the occasion of some quarrel between the
factions of the Circus, Theodoric had graciously
ordered him to assume the patronage of the Green
Faction, and to conduct the election of a pantomimic
performer for that party. He had also received permission
to erect workshops overlooking the Forum
on its northern side, on condition that his buildings
did not in any way interfere with public convenience
or the beauty of the city. Evidently he was a man
of wealth and high position, one of the great nobles
<a name="p268" id="p268"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 268</span>
of Rome, but perhaps one who, up to this time, had
not taken any very prominent part in public affairs.
His accuser, Cyprian, still apparently a young
man, was also a Roman nobleman. His father had
been consul, and he himself held at this time the
post of Referendarius (or, as I have translated it,
Reporter) in the King's Court of Appeal. His ordinary
duty was to ascertain from the suitor what was
the nature of his plea, to state it to the king, and
then to draw up the document, which contained the
king's judgment. It was an arduous office to ascertain
from the flurried and often trembling suitor, in
the midst of the hubbub of the court, the precise
nature of his complaint, and a responsible one to express
the king's judgment, neither less nor more, in
the written decree. There was evidently great scope
for corrupt conduct in both capacities, if the Referendarius
was open to bribes; and in the "Formula",
by which these officers were appointed, some stress
is laid on the necessity of their keeping a pure conscience
in the exercise of their functions. Cyprian
seems to have been a man of nimble and subtle intellect,
who excelled in his statement of a case. So
well was this done by him, from the two opposite
points of view, that plaintiff and defendant in turn
were charmed to hear each his own version of the
case so admirably presented to the king. Of later
years, Theodoric, weary of sitting in state in the
crowded hall of justice, had often tried his cases on
horseback. Riding forth into the forest he had
ordered Cyprian to accompany him, and to state in
his own lively and pleasing style the "for" and
<a name="p269" id="p269"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 269</span>
"against" of the various causes that came before
him on appeal. Even, we are told, when Theodoric
was roused to anger by the manifest injustice of the
plea that was thus presented, he could not help
being charmed by the graceful manner in which the
young Referendarius, the temporary asserter of the
claim, brought it under his notice. Thus trained to
subtle eloquence, Cyprian had been recently sent on
an embassy to Constantinople, and had there shown
himself in the word-fence a match for the keenest of
the Greeks. Lately returned, as it should seem,
from this embassy, he came forward in the Roman
Senate and accused the Patrician Albinus of outstepping
the bounds of loyalty to the Ostrogothic
King in the letters which he had addressed to the
Byzantine Emperor.</p>

<p>In this accusation was Cyprian acting the part of
an honest man or of a base informer? The times
were difficult: the relations of a Roman Senator to
Emperor and King were, as I have striven to show,
intricate and ill-defined; it was hard for even good
men to know on which side preponderated the obligations
of loyalty, of honour, and of patriotism. On
the one hand Cyprian may have been a true and
faithful servant of Theodoric, who had in his embassy
at Constantinople discovered the threads of a
treasonable intrigue, and who would not see his
master betrayed even by Romans without denouncing
their treason. As a real patriot he may have
seen that the days of purely Roman rule in Italy
were over, that there must be some sort of amalgamation
with these new Teutonic conquerors, who
<a name="p270" id="p270"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 270</span>
evidently had the empire of the world before them,
that it would be better and happier, and in a certain
sense more truly Roman, for Italy to be ruled by a
heroic "King of the Goths and Romans" than for
her to sink into a mere province ruled by exarchs and
logothetes from corrupt and distant Constantinople.
This is one possible view of Cyprian's character and
purposes. On the other hand, he may have been a
slippery adventurer, intent on carving out his own
fortune by whatever means, and willing to make
the dead bodies of the noblest of his countrymen
stepping-stones of his own ambition. In his secret
heart he may have cared nothing for the noble old
Goth, his master, with whom he had so often ridden
in the pine-wood; nothing, too, for the great name
of Rome, the city in which his father had once sat
as consul. Long accustomed to state both sides of
a case with equal dexterity, and without any belief
in either, this nimble-tongued advocate, who had
already found that Greece had nothing to teach him
that was new, may have had in his inmost soul no
belief in God, in country, or in duty, but in Cyprian
alone. Both views are possible; we have before us
only the passionate invectives of his foes and the
stereotyped commendations of his virtues penned by
his official superiors, and I will not attempt to decide
between them.</p>

<p>When Cyprian brought his charge of disloyalty
against Albinus, the accused Patrician, who was
called into the presence of the King, at once denied
the accusation. An angry debate probably followed,
in the course of which Boëthius claimed to speak
<a name="p271" id="p271"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 271</span>
The attention of all men was naturally fixed upon
him, for by the King's favour, the same favour
which in the preceding year had raised his two sons
to the consulship, he was now filling the great place
of Master of the Offices.<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a>
<a href="#footnote130"><sup class="sml">130</sup></a> "False", said Boëthius in loud, impassioned tones, "is the accusation of Cyprian;
but whatever Albinus did, I and the whole
Senate of Rome, with one purpose, did the same.
The charge is false, O King Theodoric".The inter-position
of Boëthius was due to a noble and generous
impulse, but it was not perhaps wise, in view of
all that had passed, and without in any way helping
Albinus, it involved Boëthius in his ruin. Cyprian,
thus challenged, included the Master of the Offices
in his accusation, and certain persons, not Goths,
but Romans and men of senatorial rank, Opilio (the
brother of Cyprian), Basilius, and Gaudentius, came
forward and laid information against Boëthius.</p>

<p>Here the reader will naturally ask, "Of what did
these informers accuse him?" but to that question
it is not possible to give a satisfactory answer. He
himself in his meditations on his trial says: "Of
what crime is it that I am accused? I am said to
have desired the safety of the Senate. 'In what
way?' you may ask. I am accused of having prevented
an informer from producing certain documents
in order to prove the Senate guilty of high
treason. Shall I deny the charge? But I did wish
for the safety of the Senate and shall never cease to
wish for it, nor, though they have abandoned me,
can I consider it a crime to have desired the safety
<a name="p272" id="p272"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 272</span>
of that venerable order. That posterity may know
the truth and the real sequence of events, I have
drawn up a written memorandum concerning the
whole affair. For, as for these forged letters upon
which is founded the accusation against me of having
hoped for Roman freedom, why should I say anything
about them? Their falsehood would have
been made manifest, if I could have used the confession
of the informers themselves, which in all
such affairs is admitted to have the greatest weight.
As for Roman freedom, what hope is left to us of
attaining that? Would that there were any such hope.
Had the King questioned me, I would have answered
in the words Canius, when he was questioned
by the Emperor Caligula as to his complicity in a
a conspiracy formed against him. 'If I,' said he, 'had
known, thou shouldest never have known'"</p>

<p>These words, coupled with some bitter statements
as to the tainted character of the informers against
him, men oppressed by debt and accused of peculation,
constitute the only statement of his case by
Boëthius which is now available. The memorandum
so carefully prepared in the long hours of his imprisonment
has not reached posterity. Would that
it might even yet be found in the library of some
monastery, or lurking as a palimpsest under the dull
commentary of some mediæval divine! It could
hardly fail to throw a brilliant, if not uncoloured
light on the politics of Italy in the sixth century.
But, trying as we best may to spell out the truth of
the affair from the passionate complaints of the
prisoner, I think we may discern that there had been
<a name="p273" id="p273"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 273</span>
some correspondence on political affairs between the
Senate and the Emperor Justin, correspondence
which was perfectly regular and proper if the Emperor
was still to them "Dominus Noster" (our
Lord and Master), but which was kept from the
knowledge of "the King of the Goths and Romans",
and which, when he heard of it, he was sure to resent
as an act of treachery to himself. That Boëthius,
the Master of the Offices under Theodoric, should
have connived at this correspondence, naturally exasperated
the master who had so lately heaped
favours on this disloyal servant. But in addition to
this he used the power which he wielded as Master
of the Offices, that is, head of the whole Civil Service
of Italy, to prevent some documents which
would have compromised the safety of the Senate
from coming to the knowledge of Theodoric. All
this was dangerous and doubtful work, and though
we may find it hard to condemn Boëthius, drawn as
he was in opposite directions by the claims of historic
patriotism and by those of official duty, we can
hardly wonder that Theodoric, who felt his throne
and his dynasty menaced, should have judged with
some severity the minister who had thus betrayed
his confidence.</p>

<p>The political charge against Boëthius was blended
with one of another kind, to us almost unintelligible,
a charge of sacrilege and necromancy. At least this
seems to be the only possible explanation of the following
words written by him: "My accusers saw that
the charge 'of desiring the safety of the Senate' was
no crime but rather a merit; and therefore, in order
<a name="p274" id="p274"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 274</span>
to darken it by the mixture of some kind of wickedness,
they falsely declared that ambition for office
had led me to pollute my conscience with sacrilege.
But Philosophy had chased from my breast all desire
of worldly greatness, and under the eyes of her who
had daily instilled into my mind the Pythagorean
maxim 'Follow God,' there was no place for sacrilege.
Nor was it likely that I should seek the guardianship
of the meanest of spirits when Divine Philosophy
had formed and moulded me into the likeness
of God. The friendship of my father-in-law, the venerable
Symmachus, ought alone to have shielded me
from the suspicion of such a crime. But alas! it was
my very love for Philosophy that exposed me to
this accusation, and they thought that I was of kin
to sorcerers because I was steeped in philosophic
teachings".</p>

<p>The only reasonable explanation that we can offer
of these words is that mediæval superstition was
already beginning to cast her shadow over Europe,
that already great mechanical skill, such as Boëthius
was reputed to possess when his king asked him to
manufacture the water-clock and the sun-dial, caused
its possessor to be suspected of unholy familiarity
with the Evil One; perhaps also that astronomy,
which was evidently the favourite study of Boëthius,
was perilously near to astrology, and that his zeal in
its pursuit may have exposed him to some of the
penalties which the Theodosian code itself, the law-book
of Imperial Rome, denounced against "the
mathematicians".</p>

<p>This seems to be all that can now be done towards
<a name="p275" id="p275"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 2756</span>
re-writing the lost indictment under which Boëthius
was accused. The trial was conducted with an outrageous
disregard of the forms of justice. It took
place in the Senate-house at Rome; Boëthius was
apparently languishing in prison at Pavia, where he
had been arrested along with Albinus.<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a>
<a href="#footnote131"><sup class="sml">131</sup></a> Thus at a
distance of more than four hundred miles from his
accusers and his judges was the life of this noble
Roman, unheard and undefended, sworn away on
obscure and preposterous charges by a process which
was the mere mockery of a trial. He was sentenced
to death and the confiscation of his property; and
the judges whose trembling lips pronounced the
monstrous sentence were the very senators whose
cause he had tried to serve. This thought, the remembrance
of this base ingratitude, planted the
sharpest sting of all in the breast of the condemned
patriot. It is evident that the Senate themselves
were in desperate fear of the newly awakened wrath
of Theodoric, and the fact that they found Boëthius
guilty cannot be considered as in any degree increasing
the probability of the truth of the charges made
against him. But it does perhaps somewhat lessen
his reputation for far-seeing statesmanship, since it
shows how thoroughly base and worthless was the
body for whose sake he sacrificed his loyalty to the
new dynasty, how utterly unfit the Senate would
have been to take its old place as ruler of Italy, if
<a name="p276" id="p276"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 276</span>
Byzantine Emperor and Ostrogothic King could have
been blotted out of the political firmament.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote131"
name="footnote131"></a><b>Footnote 131:</b><a href="#footnotetag131">
(return) </a> Boëthius complains thus: "Now, at a distance of nearly five hundred
miles, unheard and undefended, I have been condemned to
death and proscription for my too enthusiastic love to the Senate".
Pavia, where he seems to have been first confined, was, according to
the Antonine Itinerary, 455 Roman miles from the capital.</blockquote>

<p>Boëthius seems to have spent some months in
prison after his trial, and was perhaps transferred
from Pavia to "the <i>ager Calventianus</i>", a few miles
from Milan. There at any rate he was confined
when the messenger of death sent by Theodoric
found him. There is some doubt as to the mode of
execution adopted. One pretty good contemporary
authority says that he was beheaded, but the writer
whom I have chiefly followed, who was almost a
contemporary, but a credulous one, says that torture
was applied, that a cord was twisted round his
forehead till his eyes started from their sockets, and
that finally in the midst of his torments he received
the <i>coup de grâce</i> from a club.</p>

<p>In the interval which elapsed between the condemnation
and the death of this noble man, who died
verily as a martyr for the great memories of Rome,
he had time to compose a book which exercised a
powerful influence on many of the most heroic spirits
of the Middle Ages. This book, the well-known, if
not now often read, "Consolation of Philosophy",
was translated into English by King Alfred and by
Geoffrey Chaucer, was imitated by Sir Thomas
More (whose history in some respects resembles
that of Boëthius), and was translated into every
tongue and found in every convent library of mediæval
Europe. There is a great charm, the charm of
sadness, about many of its pages, and it may be considered
from one point of view as the swan's song of
the dying Roman world and the dying Greek philosophy,
<a name="p277" id="p277"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 277</span>
or from another, as the Book of Job of the
new mediæval world which was to be born from the
death of Rome. For like the Book of Job, the
"Consolation" is chiefly occupied with a discussion
of the eternal mystery why a Righteous and
Almighty Ruler of the world permits bad men to
flourish and increase, while the righteous are crushed
beneath their feet: and, as in the Book of Job, so
here, the question is not, probably because it cannot
be, fully answered.</p>

<p>It is the consolation of philosophy, not of religion,
or at any rate not of revealed religion, which is here
administered. So marked is the silence of Boëthius
on all those arguments, which a discussion of this
kind inevitably suggests to the mind of a believer in
the Crucified One, that scholars long supposed that
he was not even by profession a Christian. A manuscript
which has been lately discovered<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a>
<a href="#footnote132"><sup class="sml">132</sup></a> seems to
prove beyond a doubt that Boëthius was a Christian,
and wrote orthodox treatises on disputed points of
theology; but for some reason or other he fell back
on his early philosophical studies, rather than on his
formal and conventional Christianity, when he found
himself in the deep waters of adversity and imminent
death. He represents himself in the "Consolation"
as lying on his dungeon-couch, sick in body and sad
at heart, and courting the Muses as companions of
his solitude. They come at his call, but are soon unceremoniously
dismissed by one nobler than themselves,
who asserts an older and higher right to cheer
<a name="p278" id="p278"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 278</span>
her votary in the day of his calamity. This is Philosophy,
a woman of majestic stature, whose head
seems to touch the skies, and who has undying
youth and venerable age mysteriously blended in
her countenance. Having dismissed the Muses, she
sits by the bedside of Boëthius and looks with sad
and earnest eyes into his face. She invites him to
pour out his complaints; she sings to him songs first
of pity and reproof, then of fortitude and hope; she
reasons with him as to the instability of the gifts of
Fortune, and strives to lead him to the contemplation
of the <i>Summum Bonum</i>, which is God Himself,
the knowledge of whom is the highest happiness.
Then, in order a little to lighten his difficulties as to
the permission of evil by the All-wise and Almighty
One, she enters into a discussion of the relation between
Divine Foreknowledge and Human Free-will,
but this discussion, a thorny and difficult one, is not
ended when the book comes to an abrupt conclusion,
being probably interrupted by the arrival of the
messengers of Theodoric, who brought the warrant
for the writer's execution.</p>

<p>The "Consolation of Philosophy" is partly in
prose, partly in verse. The prose is generally strong,
clear, and comparatively pure in style, wonderfully
superior to the vapid diffusiveness of Cassiodorus
and most writers of the age. The interspersed poems
are sometimes in hexameters, but more often in the
shorter lines and more varied metres of Horace,
and are to some extent founded upon the tragic
choruses of Seneca. It is of course impossible in
this place to give any adequate account of so important
<a name="p279" id="p279"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 279</span>
a work and one of such far-reaching influence
as the "Consolation" but the following translation
of one of the poems in which the prisoner makes
his moan to the Almighty may give the reader some
little idea of the style and matter of the treatise.</p>

<h3>THEODORIC'S TOMB.</h3>

<p>Embassy of Pope John to Constantinople--His imprisonment and
death--Execution of Symmachus--Opportune death of Theodoric--Various
stones respecting it--His mausoleum--Ultimate fate
of his remains.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/046.png">he death of Boëthius<a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a>
<a href="#footnote133"><sup class="sml">133</sup></a> occurred
probably about the middle of 524,
and in the same year, as it would
seem, Theodoric left Verona and
returned to his old quarters at
Ravenna. The danger from the
barbarians on the northern frontier
had apparently been averted, but
a far greater danger, the hatred
and the terror of his subjects of
Roman origin, had entered his kingdom. It was
probably during this same year 524 that the zeal
of the orthodox Emperor Justin began to flame
<a name="p282" id="p282"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 282</span>
out against the Arians. Their churches were taken
from them and given to the Catholics, and, as we
hear that several Arians at this time embraced the
Catholic faith, we may conjecture that the usual
methods of conversion in that age, confiscation,
imprisonment, and possibly torture, had been pretty
freely employed. These measures, coming close
after the alleged conspiracy of the Senators, or
perhaps simultaneously with it, completed the exasperation
of Theodoric, He sent for the Pope,
John I., a Tuscan, who had been lately elevated to
the Papal chair, and when the successor of St. Peter
appeared at Ravenna commanded him, with some
haughtiness in his tone, to proceed to Constantinople,
to the Emperor Justin, and tell him that "he must
in no wise attempt to win over those whom he calls
heretics to the Catholic religion". The Pope is said
to have made some protestations, distinguishing between
his duty to God and his duty to his king, but
nevertheless accepted a commission of some kind or
other to treat with the Emperor on the subject of
mutual toleration between Catholics and Arians.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote133"

(return) </a> Possibly of Albinus also, but he disappears from the story, according to the tantalising manner of the annalists from whom we get our information.</blockquote>

<p>(525) He set forth at the head of a brilliant train,
accompanied by Ecclesius, Bishop of Ravenna,
and Eusebius, Bishop of Fano, by Senator
Theodorus, who had been consul in 505, by Senator
Importunus, consul in 509, who was descended
from the historic family of the Decii, and from whom
his coevals expected deeds worthy of that illustrious
name, by Senator Agapetus, who had been consul
along with the Eastern Emperor in 517, and by
many other noblemen and bishops.</p>

<a name="p283" id="p283"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 283</span>

<p>The visit of a pope to Constantinople, an event
which had not occurred since the very earliest days
of the new capital, created profound sensation in
that city and was the very thing to cement that
union between the Papacy and the Empire which
constituted Theodoric's greatest danger. The whole
city poured forth with crosses and candles to meet
the Pope and his companions at the twelfth milestone,
and to testify with shouts their veneration for
the Apostles Peter and Paul, whose representative
they deemed that they saw before them. "Justinus
Augustus", the fortunate farm-lad, before whom
in his old age all the great ones of the earth prostrated
themselves in reverence, now saluted the
Vicar of St. Peter with the same gestures of adoration.
The coronation of the Emperor, who had
already been for six years on the throne, was celebrated
with the utmost magnificence, the Roman
Pontiff himself placing the diadem on his head.
Then the Pope and all the Senators with tears besought
the Emperor that their embassy might be acceptable
in his sight. In the private interviews
which were held, the Pope probably hinted to his
orthodox ally the dangers which might result to the
Catholic cause in Italy, if Theodoric, hitherto so tolerant
a heretic, should be provoked to measures of
retaliation on behalf of his Church. There does
seem to have been some modification of the persecuting
edicts against the Arians, and at least some restoration
of churches to the heretics, though certain
Papal historians, unwilling to admit that a pope
can have pleaded for any concession to misbelievers,
<a name="p284" id="p284"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 284</span>
endeavour to represent the Pope's mission as fruitless,
while the Pope's person was greeted with enthusiastic
reverence. But that which is upon the whole
our best authority declares that "the Emperor Justin
having met the Pope on his arrival as if he were
St. Peter himself, and having heard his message,
promised that he would comply with all his demands
except that the converts who had given themselves to
the Catholic faith could by no means be restored to
the Arians".</p>

<p>This last exception does not seem an unreasonable
one. Surely Theodoric could hardly have expected
that Justin would exert his Imperial power in order
to force any of his subjects back into what he deemed
a deadly heresy. But for some cause or other, probably
because he perceived the mistake which he had
committed in giving to the world so striking a demonstration
of the new alliance between Emperor and
Pope, Theodoric's ambassadors, on their return to
Ravenna, found their master in a state of wrath bordering
on frenzy. All, both Pope and Senators,
were cast into prison and there treated with harshness
and cruelty. The Pope, who was probably an
aged and delicate man, began to languish in his dungeon,
and there he died on the 25th of May, 526.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while the Papal embassy had
been absent on its mission to Constantinople, Theodoric
had perpetrated another crime under the influence
of his maddening suspicions. Symmachus,
father-in-law of Boëthius, the venerable head of the
Senate, a man of saintly life and far advanced in
years, had probably dared to show that he condemned
<a name="p285" id="p285"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 285</span>
as well as lamented the execution of his
brilliant son-in-law. Against him, therefore, a charge,
doubtless of treason, was brought by command of
the king. To be accused was of course to be condemned,
and Symmachus was put to death in one of the prisons at Ravenna.</p>

<p>After the deaths of these three men, Boëthius,
Symmachus, and Pope John, all chance of peace
between Theodoric and his subjects, and what was
worse, all chance of peace between Theodoric and
his nobler and truer self was over, and there was
nothing left him but to die in misery and remorse.
It was probably in these summer days of 526 that
(as before stated) he presented his young grandson
Athalaric to his faithful Goths as their king. An
edict was issued--and the faithful groaned when
they saw that it bore the counter-signature of a
Jewish Treasury-clerk--that on Sunday the 30th of
August all the Catholic churches of Italy should be
handed over to the Arians. But this tremendous
religious revolution was not to be accomplished, nor
was an insurrection of the Catholics to be required
in order to arrest it. The edict was published on
Wednesday the 26th of August. On the following
day the King was attacked by diarrœa, and after
three days of violent pain he died on the 30th of
August, the very day on which the churches were to
have been handed over to the heretics and ninety-seven
days after the death of the Pope.<a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a>
<a href="#footnote134"><sup class="sml">134</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote134"
name="footnote134"></a><b>Footnote 134:</b><a href="#footnotetag134">
(return) </a> The disease and death, of Theodoric are thus described by the chief contemporary authority, the "Anonymous Valesii": "Sed qui non patitur fideles cultores suos ab alienigenis opprimi, mox intulit
in eum sententiam Arrii, auctoris religionis ejus: fluxum ventris incurrit, et dum intra triduo evacuatus fuisset, eodem die, quo se gaudebat ecclesias invadere, simul regnum et animam amisit".</blockquote>

<a name="p286" id="p286"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 286</span>

<p>There is certainly something in this account of
Theodoric's death which suggests the idea of arsenical
poisoning. No hint of this kind is given by any
of the annalists, but they are all hostile to Theodoric
and disposed to see in his rapid illness and most
opportune death a Divine judgment for his meditated
persecution of the Church. On the other
hand it is impossible to read the account of his
strange incoherent deeds and words during the last
three years of his life, without suspecting that his
brain was diseased and that he was not fully
responsible for his actions. As bearing on this
question it is worth while to quote the story of his
death given by a Greek historian<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a>
<a href="#footnote135"><sup class="sml">135</sup></a>
who wrote twenty-four years after his death. It is, perhaps, only an
idle tale, but it shows the kind of stories which were
current among the citizens of Ravenna as to the
last days of their great king. "When Theodoric
was dining, a few days after the death of Symmachus
and Boëthius,<a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a>
<a href="#footnote136"><sup class="sml">136</sup></a> the servants placed on the table a
large fish's head. This seemed to Theodoric to be
the head of Symmachus, newly slain. The teeth
seemed to gnaw the lower lip, the eyes glared at
him with wrath and frenzy, the dead man appeared,
<a name="p287" id="p287"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 287</span>
to threaten him with utmost vengeance. Terrified
by this amazing portent and chilled to the bone with
fear, he hastily sought his couch, where, having
ordered the servants to pile bed-clothes upon him,
he slept awhile. Then sending for Elpidius, the
physician, he related all that had happened to him,
and wept for his sins against Symmachus and Boëthius.
And with these tears and with bitter lamentations
for the tragedy in which he had taken part,
he soon afterwards died, this being the first and last
injustice which he had committed against any of his
subjects. And it proceeded from his not carefully
sifting, as he was wont to do, the evidence on which
a capital charge was grounded".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote135"
name="footnote135"></a><b>Footnote 135:</b><a href="#footnotetag135">
(return) </a> Procopius. He was present with Belisarius in Ravenna in 540, and wrote his history of the Gothic war (first three books) probably in 550.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote136"
name="footnote136"></a><b>Footnote 136:</b><a href="#footnotetag136">
(return) </a> This is, of course, an error. Theodoric's death was about two years after that of Boëthius, and many months after that of Symmachus.</blockquote>

<p>This story of Procopius, if it have any foundation
at all, seems to show that Theodoric's last days were
passed in delirium, and might suggest a doubt
whether in the heart-break of these later years he had
not endeavoured to drown his sorrows in wine. But
it is interesting to see that the Greek historian,
though writing from a somewhat hostile point of
view, recognises emphatically the justice of Theodoric's
ordinary administration, and considers the
execution of Symmachus and Boëthius (we ought to
add the imprisonment of the Pope and his co-ambassadors)
as the one tyrannical series of acts
which marred the otherwise fair fame of a patriot-king.</p>

<p>The tomb of Theodoric still stands, a noble monument
of the art of the sixth century, outside the
walls of the north-east corner of Ravenna. This
edifice, which belongs to the same class of sepulchral
<a name="p288" id="p288"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 288</span>
buildings as the tomb of Hadrian (now better
known as the Castle of S. Angelo), is built of squared
marble stones, and consists of two storeys, the lower
one a decagon, the upper one circular. The roof is
composed of one enormous block of Istrian marble
33 feet in diameter, 3 feet in height, and weighing,
it is said, nearly 300 tons. It is a marvel and a
mystery how, with the comparatively rude engineering
appliances of that age, so ponderous a mass can
have been transported from such a distance and
raised to such a height.<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a>
<a href="#footnote137"><sup class="sml">137</sup></a> At equal intervals round
the outside of this shallow, dome-like roof, twelve
stone brackets are attached to it. They are now
marked with the names of eight Apostles and of the
four Evangelists. One conjecture as to their destination
is that they were originally crowned with
statues, perhaps of these Apostles and Evangelists;
another, to me not very probable, is, that the ropes
used (if any were used) in lifting the mighty monolith
to its place were passed through these, which
would thus be the handles of the dome.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote137"
name="footnote137"></a><b>Footnote 137:</b><a href="#footnotetag137">
(return) </a> The mausoleum of Theodoric was a work that excited the admiration of his contemporaries. The "Anonymous Valesii" writes "Se autem vivo fecit sibi monumentum ex lapide quadrato, miræ magnitudinis opus, et saxum ingens quod superponeret inquisivit".</blockquote>

<p>This mausoleum, which is generally called <i>La Rotonda</i>
by the citizens of Ravenna, was used in the
Middle Ages as the choir of the Church of S. Maria
della Rotonda, and divine service was celebrated in
it by the monks of an adjoining monastery. It is
now a "public monument" and there are few traces
left of its ecclesiastical employment. The basement,
<a name="p289" id="p289"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 289</span>
as I have seen it, is often filled with water, exuding
from the marshy soil: the upper storey is abandoned
to gloom and silence.</p>

<p>Of Theodoric himself, whose body, according to
tradition, was once deposited in a porphyry vase in
the upper storey of the mausoleum, there is now no
vestige in the great pile which in his own life-time
he raised as his intended sepulchre. Nor is this any
recent spoliation. Agnellus, Bishop of Ravenna,
writing in the days of Charlemagne, says that the
body of Theodoric was not in the mausoleum, and
had been, as he thought, cast forth out of its sepulchre,<a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a>
<a href="#footnote138"><sup class="sml">138</sup></a>
and the wonderful porphyry vase in which it
had been enclosed placed at the door of the neighbouring
monastery. A recent enquirer<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a>
<a href="#footnote139"><sup class="sml">139</sup></a> has connected
these somewhat ambiguous words of Agnellus
with a childish story told by Pope Gregory the
Great, who wrote some seventy years after the death
of Theodoric. According to this story, a holy hermit,
who lived in the island of Lipari, on the day and
hour of Theodoric's death saw him, with bound
hands and garments disarranged, dragged up the
volcano of Stromboli by his two victims Symmachus
and Pope John, and hurled by them into the fire-vomiting
crater. What more likely, it is suggested,
than that the monks of the adjoining monastery
should seize the opportunity of some crisis in the
<a name="p290" id="p290"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 290</span>
troubled history of Ravenna to cast out the body of
Theodoric from its resting-place, and so, to the ignorant
people, give point to Pope Gregory's edifying
narrative as to the disposal of his soul?</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote138"
name="footnote138"></a><b>Footnote 138:</b><a href="#footnotetag138">

name="footnote139"></a><b>Footnote 139:</b><a href="#footnotetag139">
(return) </a> Corrado Ricci, "Della Corazzo d'Oro", in "Cronologio Ravennate", 1879.</blockquote>

<p>A discovery, which was made some forty years
ago in the neighbourhood of Ravenna, may possibly
throw some light on these mysterious words of
Bishop Agnellus: "As it seems to me, he was cast
forth out of his sepulchre". In May, 1854, the
labourers employed in widening the bed of the
Canale Corsini (now the only navigable water-way
between Ravenna and the sea) came, at the depth of
about five feet beneath the sea-level, on some tumuli,
evidently sepulchral in their character, made of
bricks laid edgeways. Near one of these tumuli, but
lying apart by itself, was a golden cuirass adorned
with precious stones. The rascally labourers, when
they caught sight of their treasure, feigned to see
nothing, promptly covered it up again, and returned
at nightfall to divide the spoil. A little piece of
gold which was found lying on the ground caused
enquiries to be set on foot; the labourers were arrested,
but unfortunately the greater part of the
booty had already been cast into the melting-pot.
A few pieces were, however, recovered, and are now
in the museum at Ravenna, where they figure in the
catalogue as part of the armour of Odovacar. This
is, however, a mere conjecture, and another, at least
equally probable conjecture, is that the cuirass of
gold once covered the breast of Theodoric. The
spot where it was found is about one hundred and fifty
yards from the Rotonda, and if the monks had for any
<a name="p291" id="p291"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 291</span>
reason decided to pillage the sepulchre of its precious
deposit, this was a not improbable place where
they might hide it for a time. Certainly the self-denial
which they showed in not stripping the body
of its costly covering is somewhat surprising, but
possibly the conspirators were few in number and
the chances of war may have removed them, before
they had an opportunity to disinter the body a
second time and strip it of its cuirass, which moreover
could not have been easily disposed of without
exciting suspicion.</p>

<p>One little circumstance which seems somewhat to
confirm this theory, is the fact that there is an enrichment<a id="footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a>
<a href="#footnote140"><sup class="sml">140</sup></a>
running round the border of the cuirass
very similar in character to a decoration of the cornice
in Theodoric's tomb.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote140"
name="footnote140"></a><b>Footnote 140:</b><a href="#footnotetag140">
(return) </a> A "meandro", as it is called by Ricci.</blockquote>

<p>Whether this theory be correct or not, the indignity
which was certainly at some time offered
to the mortal remains of the great Ostrogothic king
reminds us of the similar insults offered to the body
of the great Puritan Protector, Cromwell, like Theodoric,
was carried to his grave with all the conventional
demonstrations of national mourning. He
was dragged from it again and cast out "like an
abominable branch" when the legitimate monarchy
was restored, when "Church and King" were again
in the ascendant, and when the stout soldiers, who
had made him in all but the name king <i>de facto</i>,
were obliged to bow their heads beneath the recovered
might of the king <i>de jure</i>.</p>

<br>


<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/048.png">ur special subject, the life of
Theodoric, is ended, but so closely
was the king identified with the
people that the narration can
hardly close without a sketch of
the fortunes of the Ostrogothic
nation during the generation which
followed his death. I shall not
attempt any detailed history of
this period, but shall draw merely
its broadest outlines.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the melancholy and apparently
threatening circumstances which attended the death
<a name="p293" id="p293"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 293</span>
of Theodoric, his descendants succeeded to his power
without a contest. In Spain, his grandson, Amalaric,
who had probably by this time attained his majority,
was hailed as king of the Visigoths. In Italy, Athalaric,
now barely ten years old, became the nominal
ruler, the real powers being exercised by his widowed
mother, Amalasuentha, who was guided more implicitly
than her father had been by the counsel of
Cassiodorus, and availed herself of his fertile pen for
the proclamations in which she addressed the subjects
of her son. In writing to the Roman Senate,
Cassiodorus made his child-sovereign enlarge on the
felicity of the country in which the accession of a
new ruler could take place without war or sedition or
loss of any kind to the republic. "On account of
the unsurpassed glory of the Amal race, the promise
of my youth has been preferred to the merits of all
others. The chiefs, glorious in council and in war,
have flocked to recognise me as King, so gladly that
it seems like a Divine inspiration, and the kingdom
has been changed as one changes a garment. The
general consent of Goths and Romans has crowned
one King, and they have confirmed their allegiance
by an oath. You, though distant from my person,
are as near to me in heart as they, and I therefore
call on you to follow their example. We all know
that the most excellent fathers of the Senate love
their King more fervently than other ranks of the
State, in proportion to the greater benefits which
they have received at his hand".</p>

<p>To the Senators, who had witnessed the denunciation
of Albinus, and who had been compelled with
<a name="p294" id="p294"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 294</span>
anguish of heart to vote the condemnation of
Boëthius, this allusion to the great benefits which
they had received from their Gothic sovereign might
seem almost like mockery: yet there can be little
doubt that the Senate did hail the accession of
Athalaric with acclamations, and that Amalasuentha's
administration of affairs was popular with the Roman
inhabitants of Italy. It might well be so, for this
princess, born under an Italian sky, and accustomed
from her childhood to gaze upon the great works
which Rome had constructed for the embellishment
of the peninsula, was no Goth at heart, but enthusiastically,
even unwisely, Roman. In religious matters
we are almost surprised to find that she adhered to
the Arian creed of her father and her husband, but
all talk of persecution of the Catholics ceased, and no
more was heard of the enforced cession of their
churches to the Arians. And in everything else but
religion the sympathies of the new ruler were entirely
on the side of the subject, not the dominant,
nationality. As it had been said of old that "Captive
Greece subdued her conquerors", so now was it
with subject Italy and its Gothic mistress. A diligent
student of Greek as well as of Latin literature,
able to discourse with the ambassadors of Constantinople
in well-turned Attic sentences, or to deliver
a stately Latin oration to the messengers of the
Senate, she could also, when the occasion required
brevity, wrap herself in the robe of taciturnity which
she inherited from her Teutonic ancestors, and with
few, diplomatically chosen words, make the hearer
feel his immeasurable inferiority to the "Lady of
<a name="p295" id="p295"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 295</span>
the Kingdoms". A woman with a mind thus richly
stored with the literary treasure of Greece and Rome
was likely to look with impatient scorn on the barren
and barbarous annals of her people. We in whose
ears the notes of the Teutonic minstrelsy of the
Middle Ages are still sounding, we who know that
Shakespeare, Milton, Gœthe were all one day to
arise from beneath the soil of Germanic literature,
can hardly conceive how dreary and repulsive the
national sagas, and even the every-day speech of her
people, would seem in that day to a woman of great
intellectual endowments, nor how strong would be
the antagonism between culture and national patriotism
in the heart of a princess like Amalasuentha.</p>

<p>Thus the position of things during the reign of the
young Athalaric was strangely altered from that
which had existed under his grandfather. The
"King of the Goths and Romans" was under
the sway of a mother who would make him virtually
"King of the Romans", only leaving the
Goths outside in moody isolation. Of course every
step that Amalasuentha, in the enthusiasm of her
love for things Roman, took towards the Roman
Senate carried her farther from the traditions of her
people, and lost her the love of some stern old
Gothic warriors. And, moreover, with all her great
intellectual endowments, it is clear that this highly
cultivated, statuesque, and stately woman had little
skill in reading character, little power in estimating
the force of human motives. She had read (we may
conjecture) Virgil and Sophocles, but she did not
<a name="p296" id="p296"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 296</span>
know what was in the heart of a child, and she knew
not how long a scoundrel will wait for his revenge.</p>

<p>At the time that the Gothic kingdom was thus being
administered by a child and a woman, the Roman
Empire, which had seemed effete and decaying, was
astonishing the world by its recovered and increasing
vigour. Since the death of Theodosius (more than
one hundred and thirty years before that of Theodoric)
no great historic name had illustrated the
annals of the Eastern Empire, But now, a year
after the accession of Athalaric at Ravenna, the
death of Justin, in the palace at Constantinople,
(1st Aug., 527) brought upon the scene an
Emperor who, whatever his faults, however
disastrous (as I hold it to have
been) his influence on the general happiness of the
human race, made for himself undoubtedly one of
the very greatest names in the whole series from
Julius to Palaeologus--the world-famous Emperor
<i>Justinian.</i></p>

<p>With Justinian's long wars on the Eastern frontier
of his Empire we have here no concern. He was
matched there against a terrible rival, Chosroes
Nushirvan, and at most succeeded (and that not
always) in upholding the banner of Europe against
triumphant Asia. His domestic affairs, his marriage
with the actress Theodora, the strange ascendancy
which she exerted over him through life, his magnificent
buildings, the rebellion in Constantinople
(springing out of the factions of the Hippodrome)
which had all but hurled him from his throne,--these
also are all beyond our province. So too is his
<a name="p297" id="p297"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 297</span>
noblest title to immortality, the composition by his
orders of that magnificent legal trilogy, the Code,
the Digest, and the Institutes, which summed up
whatever was most worthy of preservation in the
labours of Roman lawyers for nine centuries in the
past, and sent it forward for at least thirteen centuries
into the future to ascertain the rights and to
mould the institutions of men dwelling in lands of
the very existence of which no Roman, from the first
Julius to the last Constantine, ever dreamed. Justinian
as legislator is as much out of our present
focus as Justinian the antagonist of Persia.</p>

<p>But what we have here briefly to concern ourselves
with is that marvellous display of renewed energy by
which the Empire, under Justinian, made its presence
felt in Western Europe and Africa. During
the thirty-eight years of his reign the great world-kingdom,
which for five generations had been losing
province after province to the Barbarians, and which,
when she had once lost a game had seemed never to
have the heart to try her fortune again on the same
battle-field, now sent out her fleets and her armies,
apparently with the same confidence of success which
had once animated her Scipios and her Sullas, again
planted her victorious standards on the citadel of
Carthage, made the New Carthage in Spain, Malaga,
and distant Cadiz her own, and--what concerns our
present subject more nearly--once more asserted
the unrestricted dominion of the Roman Augustus
over Italy "from the Alps to the Sea". Let us beware
of thinking of all these great changes as strange
and precarious extensions of "the Byzantine Empire".
<a name="p298" id="p298"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 298</span>
To do so is to import the language of much later
ages into the politics of the sixth century. However
clearly we may now see that the relations thus established
between Constantinople and the western shores
of the Mediterranean were artificial, and destined
not to endure, to Justinian and his contemporaries
these were not "conquests by Constantinople", but
"the recovery of Africa, Italy, and part of Spain for
the Roman Republic".</p>

<p>The first of the Teutonic states to fall was the
kingdom of the Vandals. Its ruin was certainly
hastened by the estrangement between its royal
house and that of the Ostrogoths. We left Theodoric's
sister, the stately and somewhat domineering
Amalafrida in prison at Carthage. Soon after her
brother's death she was executed or murdered, by
order of her cousin the Catholic reformer, Hilderic.
This outrage was keenly resented by the court of
Ravenna. Hostilities between the two states were
apparently imminent, but probably Amalasuentha
felt that war, whether successful or unsuccessful,
would be too dangerous for the dynasty, and sullen
alienation took the place of the preparation of fleets
and armies. In June, 531, five years after the accession
of Athalaric, the elderly and effeminate Hilderic
was deposed by his martial subjects who had long
chafed under the rule of such a sovereign, and his
cousin, the warlike Gelimer, ascended the throne.
The deposition of Hilderic, followed for the present
not by his death but by his close imprisonment, furnished
the ambitious Justinian with a fair pretext
for war, since Hilderic was not only the ally of the
<a name="p299" id="p299"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 299</span>
Empire, and a Catholic, but was descended on his
mother's side from the great Theodosius and related
to many of the Byzantine nobility. In spite of the
opposition of the more cautious among his counsellors,
Justinian decided to despatch an expedition for
the conquest of Carthage, and about Midsummer,
533, a fleet of 500 ships, manned by 20,000 sailors
and conveying 15,000 soldiers (10,000 infantry and
5,000 cavalry), sailed forth from the Bosphorus
into the Sea of Marmora, bound for the Libyan
waters. At the head of the army was Belisarius,
now about twenty-eight years of age, a man who
came, like his Imperial master, from the highlands
of Illyricum, but who, unlike that master, was probably
of noble lineage. Three years before, he had
won the battle of Daras, defeating the Persian general,
whose army was nearly twice as numerous as
his own, and he had already shown signs of that
profound knowledge of the science, and that wonderful
mastery of the art of war which he was afterwards
to display in many a hard-fought campaign,
and which entitled him to a place in the innermost
circle of the greatest generals that the world has
seen.</p>

<p>The voyage of the Imperial fleet was slow and
tedious, and had the Vandal king been well served
by his ambassadors there was ample time to have
anticipated its attack. But Gelimer seems to have
been quite ignorant of the projected expedition, and
had actually sent off some of his best troops under
the command of his brother, Tzazo, to suppress a
rebellion which had broken out in Sardinia. Moreover,
<a name="p300" id="p300"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 300</span>
the estrangement between Vandals and Ostrogoths
was a most fortunate event for the Imperial
cause. In consequence of that estrangement Belisarius
was able to land in Sicily to refresh his soldiers
wearied with a long voyage, and to obtain accurate
information as to the preparations, or rather no-preparations,
of the enemy.</p>

<p>Early in September the army landed at the promontory
of Caput-vada, about one hundred and thirty
miles south-east of Carthage, and began their march
towards the capital. They journeyed unopposed
through friendly Catholic villages, and royal parks
beautiful in verdure and abounding in luscious fruits,
until, after eleven days, they arrived at the tenth
milestone<a id="footnotetag141" name="footnotetag141"></a>
<a href="#footnote141"><sup class="sml">141</sup></a> from Carthage, and here came the shock
of war. Gelimer had planned a combined attack on (13th Sept., 533)
the Imperial army, by himself, operating on
their rear, and his brother Ammatas making
a vigorous sally from Carthage and attacking
them in front. If the two attacks had been
really simultaneous, it might have gone hardly with
the Imperial army; but Ammatas came too soon to
the field, was defeated and slain. Gelimer arriving
later on in the day inflicted a partial defeat on the
troops of Belisarius, but, coming to the spot where
lay the dead body of his brother, he stayed so long
to bewail and to bury him that Belisarius had time
to rally his forces and to convert defeat into victory.
Gelimer fled to the open country. Belisarius pressed
on and without further opposition entered the gates
of Carthage, where he was received by the majority of
<a name="p301" id="p301"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 301</span>
the citizens, who spoke the Latin tongue, and professed
the Catholic faith, with unconcealed rejoicing.
Some Roman merchants who had been confined
for many weeks in the dungeon were (15th Sept., 533)
liberated by their anxious gaoler. But the
Imperial victory came too late for the captive
Hilderic, as he had been already put to death
in prison by order of his successor. There was thus
neither friend nor foe left to bar Justinian's claim to
rule as Augustus over Africa.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote141"
name="footnote141"></a><b>Footnote 141:</b><a href="#footnotetag141">
(return) </a> Ad Decimum.</blockquote>

<p>Belisarius was accompanied in this, as in many
subsequent expeditions, by his secretary and counsellor,
the rhetorician Procopius, who has written the
story of their wars in a style worthy of his hero-chief.
He describes the sensations of surprise at
their own good fortune, with which Belisarius and his
suite found themselves at noon of the 15 th September,
sitting in Gelimer's gorgeous banquet-hall, served
by the Vandal's lackeys and partaking of the sumptuous
repast which he had ordered to be prepared in
celebration of his anticipated victory. At this point
Procopius indulges in a strain of meditation which is
not unusual with him: "We may see hereby how
Fortune wantons in her pride, how she teaches us
that she is mistress of all things, and that she will
not suffer Man to have anything which he can call
his own".</p>

<p>Though Carthage was taken, the war was not yet
over. Tzazo, who, in the midst of his victories in
Sardinia, heard of the ruin of his country, hastened
home with a valiant and hitherto triumphant army,
and joined his brother, Gelimer, on the plain of
<a name="p302" id="p302"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 302</span>
Bulla, in Numidia. When the two brothers met
they clasped one another round the neck and for
long could not loosen their hold, yet could they
speak no word to each other, but wrung their hands
and wept; and so did each one of the companions
of Gelimer with some one of the officers of the army
of Sardinia. But tears soon gave place to the longing
for revenge, and the two armies, forming one
strong and determined host, moved eastward to
Tricamaron, about twenty miles distant from Carthage,
and began a partial blockade of the capital.
On the 15 th December Belisarius met the Vandals in
battle-array. The fight was more stubbornly contested
than that of Ad Decimum; but Tzazo fell in
the thickest of the battle, and again the impulsive
nature of Gelimer was so moved by the sight of a
brother's blood that he renounced the struggle for
his crown and galloped away from the field.</p>

<p>Now the conquest of Africa was indeed completed,
but Belisarius was set upon capturing the person of
the fugitive king, as an ornament to his triumph and
the pledge of victory. The tedious task was delegated
to a Teutonic chief named Pharas, who for
three months beleaguered the impregnable hill on
the confines of Mauritania, on the summit of which
was the fortress in which Gelimer had taken refuge.
The incidents which marked his final surrender have
been often described. He who had been of late the
daintily-living lord of Africa found life hard indeed
among the rough, half-savage Moors, who were partly
his body-guard and partly his gaolers. An ambassador
sent by Pharas to exhort him to surrender and
<a name="p303" id="p303"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 303</span>
cast himself on the clemency of Justinian brought
back his proud refusal to submit to one who had
done him so much undeserved wrong, but brought
back also a pathetic request that his courteous foe
would grant him three things, a lyre, a sponge, and a
loaf of bread. The loaf was to remind him of the taste
of baked bread, which he had not eaten for months;
the sponge was to bathe his eyes, weakened with continual
tears; the lyre, to enable him to set to music
an ode which he had composed on the subject of his
misfortunes. A few days more passed by, and then
came Gelimer's offer to surrender at discretion, trusting
to the generosity of the Emperor. What finally
broke down his proud spirit was the sight of a delicately
nurtured child, the son of one of his Vandal
courtiers, fighting with a dirty little Moor for a half-baked
piece of dough, which the two boys had
pulled out of the ashes where it was baking.</p>

<p>Gelimer, whose reason was perhaps somewhat unhinged
by his hardships, gave a loud laugh--professedly
at the instability of human greatness--when
brought into the presence of Belisarius. He and his
captors soon embarked for Constantinople, where
they arrived probably about the middle of 534. It
had thus taken less than a year to level with the
ground the whole fabric of Vandal dominion, reared
a century before by the terrible Gaiseric, and to reunite
Africa to the Roman Republic. Belisarius
received a splendid triumph, the chief figure of
which was of course the captive Gelimer, who, with
a purple robe on his shoulders, paced through the
streets, shouting ever and anon in a melancholy
<a name="p304" id="p304"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 304</span>
voice, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity". When the
procession reached the palace, Gelimer by constraint
and Belisarius willingly prostrated themselves at the
feet of "Justinianus Augustus". The promises on the
faith of which the Vandal king had surrendered himself
were well kept. He might have been raised to
the dignity of Patrician, if he would have renounced
his Arian creed. As it was, he lived in honourable
exile on the large estates in Galatia, which he had
received from the bounty of the Emperor.</p>

<p>In the same year (534) which witnessed the triumph
of Belisarius over the conquered Vandals came
the final overthrow of the Burgundian monarchy.
In 523 Sigismund, the son-in-law of Theodoric, the
convert to Catholicism who ordered the murder of
his son, had been defeated in battle by the sons of
Clovis, and together with his wife and two sons had
been thrown down a deep well and so slain.
Theodoric, incensed   at the murder of his
grandson, had taken part against Sigismund and
obtained a large accession of territory in Dauphiné
as the price of his alliance with the Franks. But a
brother of Sigismund's, named Godamir, rallied the
beaten Burgundians, defeated the Franks in a battle
in which one of their kings was slain, and succeeded
in maintaining for eleven years longer the independence
of his nation. In the year 532, however, the
Frankish kings again entered the valley of the Rhone
with their desolating hosts, and in 534 they completed
its conquest and added it to the great unwieldy
monarchy over which they ruled in a kind of
family partnership.</p>

<a name="p305" id="p305"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 305</span>

<p>In Spain too the Frankish kings had achieved
some successes, and at the cost of a descendant of
Theodoric. Amalaric, king of the Visigoths, had
married, probably after his grandfather's death, Clotilda,
daughter of Clovis, and for a time seems to
have pursued a tolerant policy towards the Catholics,
but gradually drifted into a position of unreasoning
and barbarous hostility towards them, hostility
from which his own wife was not exempted. He
caused filth to be cast at the devout Clotilda, when
she was on her way to the Catholic basilica, nay,
he even lifted his hand to strike her. The cowardly
blow brought blood, and the drops of this blood,
royal and Frankish, collected on a handkerchief and
sent northward over the Pyrenees, brought the two
brother-kings of the Franks into Spain (431). Amalaric
was defeated,<a id="footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a>
<a href="#footnote142"><sup class="sml">142</sup></a> fled to Barcelona, and sought to escape thence by sea, probably to Italy; but his
passage to the harbour was barred by his own mutinous
soldiers, and he perished by a javelin hurled by
one of them. The Franks returned, enriched with
great booty, to their own land, and Theudis, the
Ostrogothic noble, whose power had long overshadowed
his master's, and who was accused by
some of having caused the mutiny of his troops,
succeeded to his throne.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote142"
name="footnote142"></a><b>Footnote 142:</b><a href="#footnotetag142">
(return) </a> At Narbonne. The part of Languedoc called Septimania was still held by the Visigoths.</blockquote>

<p>So had the great Arian league and the network of
family alliances, by which Theodoric had sought to
guard it from the spoiler, passed away into nothingness:
and thus did the Ostrogothic kingdom now
<a name="p306" id="p306"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 306</span>
stand alone and without allies before the rejuvenated
Empire, flushed with victory, and possessing such a
head as Justinian, such a terrible right arm as Belisarius.
Not many months had elapsed from the battle
of Tricamaron when the ambassadors of the Empire
appeared at Ravenna to present those claims out of
which Greek ingenuity would soon fashion a pretext
for war. The town of Lilybæum, in Sicily had long ago
been handed over by Theodoric to the Vandal king
Thrasamund as part of Amalafrida's dowry. Apparently
it had been recaptured by the Goths after the
death of the Vandal queen, but Justinian urged that
it was still the rightful possession of Gelimer, and
therefore of himself, who now by the fortune of war
was Gelimer's master. Then there were certain
Huns, deserters from the Emperor's service, who
had been allowed by the governor of Naples to enlist
in the Gothic army. A Gothic general who had to
conduct some warlike operations near Sirmium had
crossed the Danube and sacked Gratiana, a city in
Mœsia. All these grievances were rehearsed by the
Imperial ambassador, who hinted, not obscurely, that
war would follow if they were not redressed.</p>

<p>In fact, however, the real object of the embassy
which came with this formal statement of grievances
was to discuss a strange proposition which had been
made by Amalasuentha, one for the understanding
of which we must go back a few years (we are not
told exactly how many) to an event which illustrates
the manner in which the Gothic princess conducted
the education of her son. She wished, we are told,
to have him brought up in all respects after the
<a name="p307" id="p307"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 307</span>
manner of the Romans, and forced him every day to
go to the house of a grammarian to learn his lessons.
Moreover, she chose out three Gothic ancients, men
of wisdom and of calm, reasonable temperament, and
assigned these venerable persons to Athalaric as his
constant companions. This manner of training the
kingly boy did not at all suit the ideas of the Goths,
the Roman historian says, "because they wished
him to be trained in more barbaric style in order that
they might have the more liberty for oppressing
their subjects": a modern historian may suggest,
"because they remembered their own childhood and
knew what was in the heart of a boy", of which
Amalasuentha, who was evidently elderly and wise
in her cradle, had no conception. One day, for
some childish offence, the young king was slapped
in the face by his mother, and thereupon, in a tempest
of passionate tears, he burst out of the women's
apartments and appeared sobbing in the men's hall
of audience. All Gothic hearts were stirred when
they saw the princely Amal thus mishandled, and
the warriors began to hint the insulting suspicion
that Amalasuentha wished to educate her child into
his grave, that she might marry again and make her
new husband king of the Goths and Romans. The
nobles of the nation were gathered together, and
seeking an audience with the princess, their spokesman
thus addressed her: "O lady, you are not
dealing justly by us, nor doing that which is expedient
for the nation, in your way of educating your
son. Letters and book-learning are very different
from manly courage and fortitude, and to hand a lad
<a name="p308" id="p308"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 308</span>
over to the teaching of greybeards is generally the
way to make him a coward and a caitiff. He who is
to do daring deeds and win glory in the world must
be emancipated from fear of the pedagogue and be
practising martial exercises. Your father Theodoric
would never suffer his Goths to send their sons to
the grammarian-school, for he used to say: 'If they
fear their teacher's strap now they will never look on
sword or javelin without a shudder.' And he himself,
who won the lordship of such wide lands, and
died king of so fair a kingdom which he had not inherited
from his fathers, knew nothing even by hearsay
of this book-learning. Therefore, lady, you must
say 'good-bye' to these pedagogues, and give Athalaric
companions of his own age, who may grow up
with him to manhood and make of him a valiant king
after the pattern of the barbarians".</p>

<p>Amalasuentha listened with outward calmness to
this harangue, and though filled with secret indignation
recognised the people's voice to which she was
forced to bow. The meek old men were removed
from Athalaric's bed-chamber; he was released from
his daily attendance on the grammarian; and some
young Gothic nobles were assigned to him as associates.
But the rebound was too sudden. His barbarian
comrades led astray the young king's heart
after wine and women. His health began to be
undermined by his excesses, and the surly ill-nature
which he manifested towards his mother was a sure
indication of the defenceless position in which she
would find herself as soon as her son should assume
the reins of government. Feeling these reins slipping
<a name="p309" id="p309"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 309</span>
from her grasp, she opened secret negotiations
with Justinian to assure herself of his protection in case
she should be driven from Italy by rebellion. But
in the meantime she singled out three of the Gothic
nobles who had been prominent in the revolt against
her authority and sent them, on one pretext or
another connected with the defence of the realm,
to widely separated towns on the extreme borders
of Italy. Though severed, they still found means
to hold mutual communications and to plot the
downfall of the princess. Informed of this conspiracy,
she freighted a vessel with forty thousand
pounds' weight of gold (£1,6000,000) and sent it to
Dyrrhachium, on the eastern shore of the Adriatic,
to await her further orders. If things should go ill
with her she would thus, in any event, have a line of
retreat opened towards Constantinople and a comfortable
subsistence assured to her in that capital.
Having taken these precautions, she gave a commission
to some of her bravest and most devoted followers
(for she evidently had a strong party in her
favour) to seek out the three disaffected nobles in
their various places of banishment and put them to
death. Her henchmen obeyed her bidding; no
popular tumult was excited; the sceptre seemed to
be more firmly than ever grasped by the hand of the
princess; the ship, without having discharged its
cargo, was ordered back from Dyrrhachium, and
there came a slight lull in the underground negotiations
with Constantinople.</p>

<p>But another candidate for the favours of Justinian
was also appearing in the royal family of the Goths.
<a name="p310" id="p310"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 310</span>
Theodahad, son of Amalfrida, and therefore nephew
of Theodoric, was a man now pretty far advanced in
middle life. He had received in his boyhood that
literary and rhetorical training which Amalasuentha
yearned to bestow on her son; he was well versed in
the works of the Roman orators and could discourse
learnedly on the dialogues of Plato. Unhappily, this
varnish of intellectual culture covered a thoroughly
vile and rotten character. He was averse to all the
warlike employments of his forefathers, but his whole
heart was set on robbery, under the form of civilisation,
by means of extortion and chicane. He had
received from his uncle ample estates in the fertile
province of Tuscany, but he was one who, as the
common people said, "could not endure a neighbour",
and, on one pretence or other, he was perpetually
adding farm after farm and villa after villa
to his enormous property. Already during his
uncle's reign the grave pen of Cassiodorus had been
twice employed to censure Theodahad's avarice, "a
vulgar vice, which the kinsman of the king and a
man of Amal blood is especially bound to avoid",
and to complain that "you, who should have shown
an example of glorious moderation, have caused the
scandal of high-handed spoliation". After Theodoric's
death the process of unjust accumulation went
on rapidly. From every part of Tuscany the cry
went up that the provincials were being oppressed
and their lands taken from them on no pretext
whatever; and the Counts of the Royal Patrimony
had to complain that even the king's domain was
suffering from Theodahad's depredations. He was
<a name="p311" id="p311"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 311</span>
summoned to the <i>Comitatus</i> or King's Court, at
Ravenna; his various acts of alleged spoliation were
inquired into; their injustice was clearly proved, and
he was compelled by Amalasuentha to restore the
wrongfully appropriated lands.</p>

<p>It was perhaps before this process was actually begun,
but after Theodahad was made aware that the
clamour against him was growing louder and had
reached the ears of his cousin, that he sought an
interview with the Bishops of Ephesus and Philippi,
who had come over to Italy on some ecclesiastical
errand from the Emperor to the Pope. To these
clerical ambassadors Theodahad made the extraordinary
proposal that Justinian should buy of him the
province of Tuscany for a certain large sum of
money, to which was to be added the dignity of a
Senator of Constantinople. If this negotiation could
be carried through, the diligent student of Plato and
Cicero proposed to end his days in dignified retirement
at the Eastern capital.</p>

<p>We may now return to the palace of Ravenna and
be present at the audience granted, probably in the
summer of 534, by Amalasuentha to Alexander, the
ambassador of Justinian. To the demands for the
surrender of Lilybæum and the complaints as to the
enlistment of Hunnish deserters, Amalasuentha made,
in public, a suitable and sprited reply: "It was not
the part of a great and courageous monarch to pick
a quarrel with an orphaned king, too young to be
accurately informed of what was going on in all
parts of his dominions, about such paltry matters as
the possession of Lilybæum, a barren and worthless
<a name="p312" id="p312"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 312</span>
rock of Sicily, about ten wild Huns who had sought
refuge in Italy, and about the offence which the
Gothic soldiers had, in their ignorance, committed
against a friendly city in Mœsia. Justinian should
look at the other side of the account, should remember
the aid and comfort which his soldiers, on their
expedition against the Vandals, had received from
the friendly Ostrogoths in Sicily, and should ask
himself whether without that aid he would ever have
recovered possession of Africa. If Lilybæum did
belong by right to the Emperor it was not too great
a reward for him to bestow on his young ally for such
opportune assistance".</p>

<p>This was publicly the answer of Amalasuentha--a
bold and determined refusal to surrender the rock
of Lilybæum. In her private interview with the
ambassador, she assured him that she was ready to
fulfil her compact and to make arrangements for
the transfer to the Emperor of the whole of Italy.</p>

<p>When the two sets of ambassadors, civil and
ecclesiastical, returned to Constantinople the Emperor
perceived that here were two negotiations to
be carried on of the most delicate kind and requiring
the presence of a master of diplomacy. He accordingly
despatched to Ravenna a rhetorician named
Peter, a man of considerable intellectual endowments--he
was a historian as well as an orator--and one
who had, eighteen years before, held the high office
of consul. But it was apparently winter before Peter
started on his journey, and when he arrived at Aulon
(now Valona), just opposite Brindisi, he heard such
startling tidings as to the events which had occurred
<a name="p313" id="p313"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 313</span>
on the Italian side of the Adriatic, that he waited
there and asked for further instructions from his
master as to the course which he was to pursue in
the existing position of affairs. (2nd Oct., 534.)</p>

<p>First of all came the death of the unhappy lad,
Athalaric, in his eighteenth year, the victim of unwise
strictness, followed by unwise licence, and of
the barbarian's passion for swinish and sensual pleasures.
When her son was dead, Amalasuentha, who
had an instinctive feeling that the Goths would
never submit to undisguised female sovereignty,
took a strange and desperate resolution.
She sent for Theodahad, now the only
surviving male of the stock of Theodoric, and,
fashioning her lips to a smile, began to apologise for
the humiliating sentence which had issued against
him from the King's Court. "She had known all
along", she said, "that her boy would die, and as
he, Theodahad, would then be the one hope of
Theodoric's line, she had wished to abate his unpopularity
and set him straight with his future
subjects by strictly enforcing their rights against
him. Now all that was over: his record was clear
and she was ready to invite him to become the
partner of her throne;<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a>
<a href="#footnote143"><sup class="sml">143</sup></a> but he must first swear the
most solemn oaths that he would be satisfied with
the name of royalty and that the actual power should
remain, as it had done for nine years, in the hands of
Amalasuentha".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote143"
name="footnote143"></a><b>Footnote 143:</b><a href="#footnotetag143">
(return) </a> As colleague, not as husband; Theodahad's wife, Gudelina, was still living when he ascended the throne.</blockquote>

<p>Theodahad cheerfully swore tremendous oaths to
<a name="p314" id="p314"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 314</span>
the observance of this compact. Proclamations in
the name of the two new sovereigns were put forth
to all the Goths and Italians. In them Theodahad
grovelled in admiration of the wisdom, the virtue,
the eloquence of the noble lady who had raised him
to so high a station and who had done him the inestimable
favour of making him feel her justice
before she bestowed upon him her grace. Few
weeks, however, passed, before Amalasuentha was a
prisoner, hurried away to a little lonely island in the
Lake of Bolsena in Tuscany by order of the partner
of her throne. Having taken this step, Theodahad
began with craven apologies to excuse it to the
Eastern Cæsar. "He had done no harm to Amalasuentha;
he would do no harm to her, though she
had been guilty of the most nefarious designs
against him: he only sought to protect her from
the vengeance of the kinsmen of the three Gothic
nobles whom she had murdered". An embassy
composed of Roman Senators was ordered to carry
this tale to Justinian and to confirm it by a letter
which, under duresse, had been wrung from the unfortunate
princess in her prison. When the ambassadors
arrived at Constantinople one of them spoke
the words of the part which had been set down for
him and declared that Theodahad had done nothing
against Amalasuentha of which any reasonable complaint
could be made; but the others, headed by
the brave Liberius, "a man of singularly high and
noble nature, and of the most watchful regard to
truth", told the whole story exactly as it had happened
to the Emperor. The result was a despatch
<a name="p315" id="p315"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 315</span>
to the ambassador Peter enjoining him to find means
of assuring Amalasuentha that Justinian would exert
all his influence for her safety, and to inform Theodahad
publicly, in presence of all his counsellors,
that it was at his own peril that he would touch a
hair of the head of the Gothic queen.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had Peter touched the Italian
shore--he had not conveyed a letter to the prison
nor uttered a word in the palace--when the sad
tragedy was ended. The relations of the three
nobles, who had "blood-feud" with the queen, and
who were perhaps, according to the code of barbarian
morality, justified in avenging their death, made
their way to Amalasuentha's island prison, and there,
in that desolate abode, the daughter of Theodoric
met her death at their hands, dying with all that
stately dignity and cold self-possession with which
she had lived.</p>

<p>Justinian's ambassador at once proceeded to the
King's Court, and there, in the presence of all the
Gothic nobles, denounced the foul deed which they
had permitted to be done, and declared that for this
there must be "truceless war" between the Emperor
and them. Theodahad, as stupid as he was vile, renewed
his ridiculous protestations that he had no
part in the violence done to Amalasuentha, but had
heard of it with the utmost regret, and this although
he had already rewarded the murderers with signal
tokens of his favour.</p>

<p>Thus, by the folly of the wise and the criminal
audacity of the coward, had a train been laid for the
destruction of the Ostrogothic kingdom. All the
<a name="p316" id="p316"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 316</span>
petty pretexts for war, the affair of Lilybæum, the
Hunnish deserters, the sack of Gratiana, faded into
insignificance before this new and most righteous
cause of quarrel. If Hilderic's deposition had been
avenged by the capture of Carthage, with far more
justice might the death of the noble Amalasuentha
be avenged by the capture of Ravenna and of Rome.
In the great war which was soon to burst upon Italy
Justinian could figure not only as the protector of
the provincials, not only as the defender of the
Catholics, but as the avenger of the blood of the
daughter of Theodoric.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>


<h3>BELISARIUS.</h3>

<p>Justinian begins his great Gothic war--Dalmatia recovered for the
Empire--Belisarius lands in Sicily--Siege of Palermo--The
South of Italy overrun--Naples taken by a stratagem--Theodahad
deposed by the Goths--Witigis elected king--The Goths
evacuate Rome--Belisarius enters it--The long siege of Rome
by the Goths who fail to take it--Belisarius marches northward
and captures Ravenna</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/051.png">he Emperor's preparations for the
Gothic war were soon made, and
in the summer of 535 two armies
were sent forth from Constantinople,
one destined to act on the east
and the other on the west of the
Adriatic. When we think of the
mighty armaments by means of
which Pompey and Cæsar, or even
Licinius and Constantine, had
contended for the mastery of the Roman world, the
forces entrusted to the generals of Justinian seem
strangely small. We are not informed of the precise
number of the army sent to Dalmatia, but the whole
<a name="p318" id="p318"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 318</span>
tenor of the narrative leads us to infer that it consisted
of not more than 3,000 or 4,000 men. It
fought with varying fortunes but with ultimate success.
Salona, the Dalmatian capital, was taken by
the Imperial army, wrested from them by the Goths,
retaken by the Imperialists. The Imperial general,
a brave old barbarian named Mundus, fell dead by
the side of his slaughtered son; but another general
took his place, and being well supported by a naval
expedition, succeeded, as has been said, in reconquering
Salona, drove out the Gothic generals, and
reincorporated Dalmatia with the Empire. This
province, which had for many generations been
treated almost as a part of Italy, was now for four
centuries to be for the most part a dependency of
Constantinople. The Dalmatian war was ended by
the middle of 536.</p>

<p>But it was of course to the Italian expedition that
the eyes of the spectators of the great drama were
most eagerly turned. Here Belisarius commanded,
peerless among the generals of his own age, and not
surpassed by many of preceding or following ages.
The force under his command consisted of only 7,500
men, the greater part of whom were of barbarian
origin--Huns, Moors, Isaurians, Gepidse, Heruli,
but they were welded together by that instinct of
military discipline and that unbounded admiration
for their great commander and confidence in his
success which is the surest herald of victory. Not
only in nationality but in mode of fighting they were
utterly unlike the armies with which republican
Rome had won the sovereignty of the world. In
<a name="p319" id="p319"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 319</span>
those days it might have been truly said to the inhabitant
of the seven-hilled city as Macaulay has
imagined Capys saying to Romulus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Thine, Roman | is the pilum:</p>
<p> Roman | the sword is thine.</p>
<p> The even trench, the bristling mound,</p>
<p> The legion's ordered line"--</p>
</div></div>

<p>but now, centuries of fighting with barbarian foes,
especially with the nimble squadrons of Persia, had
completely changed the character of the Imperial
tactics. It was to the deadly aim of his <i>Hippo-toxotai</i>
(mounted bowmen) that Belisarius, in pondering
over his victories, ascribed his antonishing
success. "He said that at the beginning of his first
great battle he had carefully studied the characteristic
differences of each army, in order that he might
prevent his little band from being overborne by
sheer force of numbers. The chief difference which
he noted was that almost all the Roman (Imperialist)
soldiers and their Hunnish allies were good <i>Hippo-toxotai</i>,
while the Goths had none of them practised
the art of shooting on horseback. Their cavalry
fought only with javelins and swords, and their
archers fought on foot covered by the horsemen.
Thus till the battle became a hand-to-hand encounter
the horsemen could make no reply to the arrows
discharged at them from a distance, and were therefore
easily thrown into disorder, while the foot-soldiers,
though able to reply to the enemy's archers,
could not stand against the charges of his horse".<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a>
<a href="#footnote144"><sup class="sml">144</sup></a>
From this passage we can see what were the means
<a name="p320" id="p320"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 320</span>
by which Belisarius won his great victories. While
the Goth, with his huge broadsword and great
javelin, chafing for a hand-to-hand encounter with
the foe, found himself mowed down by the arrows
of a distant enemy, the nimble barbarian who called
himself a Roman solder discharged his arrows at the
cavalry, dashed in impetuous onset against the infantry,
wheeled round, feigned flight, sent his arrows
against the too eagerly advancing horsemen, in fact,
by Parthian tactics won a Roman victory, or to use a
more modern illustration, the <i>Hippo-toxotai</i> were the
"Mounted Rifles" of the Imperial army.</p>

<p>The expedition under the command of Belisarius
made its first attack on the Gothic kingdom in Sicily.
Here the campaign was little more than a triumphant
progress. In reliance on its professions of loyalty,
Theodoric and his successors had left the wealthy
and prosperous island almost bare of Gothic troops,
and now the provincials, eager to form once more a
part of the Eternal Roman Empire, opened the
gates of city after city to the troops of Justinian;
only at Palermo was a stout resistance made by the
Gothic soldiers who garrisoned the city. The walls
were strong, and that part of them which bordered
on the harbour was thought to be so high and massive
as not to need the defence of soldiers. When
unobserved by the foe, Belisarius hoisted up his
men, seated in boats, to the yard-arms of his ships
and made them clamber out of the boats on to
the unguarded parapet. This daring manœuvre
gave him the complete command of the Gothic position,
and the garrison capitulated without delay. So
<a name="p321" id="p321"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 321</span>
was the whole island of Sicily won over to the realm
of Justinian before the end of 535, and Belisarius,
Consul for the year, rode through the streets of Syracuse
on the last day of his term of office, scattering his
"donative" to the shouting soldiers and citizens.</p>

<p>Operations in 536, the second year of the war,
were suspended for some months by a military mutiny
at Carthage, which called for the presence of
Belisarius in Africa. But the mutineers quailed before
the very name of their late commander. Carthage
was delivered from the siege wherewith they
were closely pressing it, a battle was won in the
open field, and the rebellion though not yet finally
crushed was sufficiently weakened for Belisarius to
return to Sicily in the late spring of 536. He
crossed the Straits of Messina, landed in Italy, was
received by the provincials of Bruttii and Lucania
with open arms, and met with no check to his progress
till, probably in the early days of June, he stood
with his army under the walls of the little town of
Neapolis, which in our own days is represented by a
successor ten times as large, the superbly situated city
of Naples. Here a strong Gothic garrison held the
place for Theodahad and prevented the surrender
which many of the citizens, especially those of the
poorer class, would gladly have made. An orator,
who was sent by the Neapolitans to plead their
cause in the general's camp, vainly endeavoured to
persuade Belisarius to march forward to Rome,
leaving the fate of, Naples to be decided under the
walls of the capital. The Imperial general could
not leave so strong a place untaken in his rear, and
<a name="p322" id="p322"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 322</span>
though himself anxious enough to meet Theodahad,
commenced the siege of the city. His land army
was supported by the fleet which was anchored in
the harbour, yet the operations of the siege languished,
and after twenty days Belisarius seemed to
be no nearer winning the prize of war than on the
first day. But just then one of his soldiers, a brave
and active Isaurian mountaineer, reported that he
had found a means of entering the empty aqueduct
through which, till Belisarius severed the communication,
water had been supplied to the city. The
passage was narrow, and at one point the rock had
to be filed away to allow the soldiers to pass,
but all this was done without arousing the suspicions
of the besieged, and one night Belisarius
sent six hundred soldiers, headed by the Isaurian,
into the aqueduct, having arranged with them the
precise portion of the walls to which they were to
rush as soon as they emerged into the city. The
daring attempt succeeded. The soldiers found themselves
in a large cavern with a narrow opening at the
top, on the brink of which was a cottage. Some of
the most active among them swarmed up the sides
of the cave, found the cottage inhabited by one old
woman who was easily frightened into silence, and let
down a stout leather thong which they fastened to
the stem of an olive-tree, and by which all their comrades
mounted. They rushed to that part of the
walls beneath which Belisarius was standing, blew
their trumpets, and assisted the besiegers to ascend.
The Gothic garrison were taken prisoners and treated
honourably by Belisarius. The city suffered some
<a name="p323" id="p323"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 3234</span>
of the usual horrors of a sack from the wild Hunnish
soldiers of the Empire, but these were somewhat
mitigated, and the citizens who had been taken
prisoners were restored to liberty, in compliance with
the earnest entreaties of Belisarius.</p>

<p>The fall of Neapolis, to whose assistance no Gothic
army had marched, and the unhindered conquest of
Southern Italy crowned the already towering edifice
of Theodahad's unpopularity. It is not likely that
this selfish and unwarlike pedant--a "nithing", as
they probably called him--had ever been aught but
a most unwelcome necessity to the lion-hearted Ostrogoths,
and for all but the families and friends of
the three slain noblemen, the imprisonment and the
permitted murder of his benefactress must have
deepened dislike into horror. His dishonest intrigues
with Constantinople were known to many,
intrigues in which even after Amalasuentha's death he
still offered himself and his crown for sale to the Emperor,
and the Emperor, notwithstanding his brave
words about a truceless war, seemed willing to pay
the caitiff his price. Some gleams of success
which shone upon the Gothic arms in Dalmatia
towards the end of 535 filled the feeble soul of Theodahad
with presumptuous hope, and he broke off
with arrogant faithlessness the negotiations which
he had begun. Still, with all the gallant men under
him longing to be employed, he struck not one blow
for his crown and country, but shut himself up in
his palace, seeking by the silliest auguries to ascertain
the issue of the war. The most notable of
these vaticinations was "the Augury of the Hogs",
<a name="p324" id="p324"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 324</span>
which he practised by the advice of a certain Jewish
magician. He shut up in separate pens three batches
of hogs, each batch consisting of ten. One batch
was labelled "Romans" (meaning the Latin-speaking
inhabitants of Italy), another "Goths", and the
third "Soldiers of the Emperor". They were all left
for a certain number of days without food, and
when the appointed day was come, and the pens
were opened, all the "Gothic" hogs but two were
found dead. The "Emperor's soldiers", with very
few exceptions, were living; of the "Romans" half
only were alive, and all had lost their bristles.
Ridiculous as the manner of divination was, it furnished
no inapt type of the miseries which the
Gothic war was to bring upon all concerned in it,
and not least upon that Latin population which was
still so keen to open its gates to Belisarius.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, when Neapolis had fallen, the
brave Gothic warriors felt that they had submitted
too long to the rule of a dastard like Theodahad.
They met in arms, a nation-parliament, on the plain
of Regeta, about forty-three miles from Rome in
the direction of Terracina. Here there was plenty
of grass for the pasture of their horses, and here,
while the steeds grazed, the dismounted riders could
deliberate as to the fortunes of the state. There
was found to be an unanimous determination that
Iheodahad should be dethroned, and, instead of him,
they raised on the shield, Witigis, a man somewhat
past middle age, not of noble birth, who had distinguished
himself by his deeds of valour thirty
years before in the war of Sirmium. As soon as
<a name="p325" id="p325"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 325</span>
Theodahad heard the tidings of his deposition, he
sought to escape with all speed to Ravenna. The
new king ordered a Goth named Optaris to pursue
him and bring him back alive or dead. Optaris had
his own wrongs to avenge, for he had lost a rich and
beautiful bride through Theodahad's purchased interference
on behalf of another suitor. He followed
him day and night, came up with him while still on
the road, "made him lie down on the pavement, and
cut his throat as a priest cuts the throat of a victim".<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a>
<a href="#footnote145"><sup class="sml">145</sup></a>
So did Theodahad perish, one of the meanest insects that ever crawled across the page of history.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote145"
name="footnote145"></a><b>Footnote 145:</b><a href="#footnotetag145">
(return) </a> There was perhaps an interval of some months during which
Theodahad was in hiding. His deposition is fixed by one authority
(Anastasius) to August, and his death, by another (Agnellus), to
December, 536, but all our chronological details as to this part of the history are vague and uncertain.</blockquote>

<p>Witigis, the new king of the Goths, had personal
courage and some experience of battles, but he was
no statesman and, as the event proved, no general.
By his advice, the Goths committed the astounding
blunder of abandoning Rome and concentrating their
forces for defence in the north of Italy. It is true
that a garrison of four thousand Goths was left in
the city under the command of the brave veteran
Leudaris, but, unsupported by any army in the field,
this body of men was too small to hold so vast a city
unless they were aided by the inhabitants. As for
Witigis, he marched northward to Ravenna with the
bulk of the Gothic army and there celebrated, not a
victory, but a marriage. The only remaining scion
of the race of Theodoric was a young girl named
<a name="p326" id="p326"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 326</span>
Matasuentha, the sister of Athalaric. In some vain
hope of consolidating his dynasty, Witigis divorced
his wife and married this young princess. The marriage
was, as might have been expected, an unhappy
one. Matasuentha shared the Romanising tendencies
of her mother, and her spirit revolted against the
alleged reasons of state which gave her this elderly
and low-born barbarian for a husband. In the darkest
hour of the Gothic fortunes (540) Matasuentha was
suspected of opening secret negotiations with the
Imperial leaders, and even of seeking to aid the
progress of their arms by crime.</p>

<p>By the end of November, 536, Belisarius, partly
aided by the treachery of the Gothic general who commanded
in Samnium, had recovered for the Empire
all that part of the Italian peninsula which, till lately,
formed the Kingdom of Naples. Pope Silverius,
though he had sworn under duresse an oath of fealty
to King Witigis, sent messengers offering to surrender
the Eternal City, and the four thousand Goths,
learning what negotiations were going forward, came
to the conclusion that it was hopeless for them to
attempt to defend the City against such a general as
Belisarius and against the declared wish of the citizens.
They accordingly marched out of Rome by
a northern gate as Belisarius entered it on the south.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a>
<a href="#footnote146"><sup class="sml">146</sup></a> The brave old Leudaris, refusing to abandon his
trust, was taken prisoner, and sent, together with
the keys of the City, to Justinian, most undoubted
evidences of victory.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote146"
name="footnote146"></a><b>Footnote 146:</b><a href="#footnotetag146">

<p>Belisarius took up his headquarters in the Pincian
<a name="p327" id="p327"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 327</span>
Palace (on that hill at the north of the City which
is now the fashionable promenade of the Roman
aristocracy), and from thence commanded a wide
outlook over that part of the Campagna on which,
as he knew, a besieging army would shortly encamp.
He set to work with all speed to repair the walls of
the City, which had been first erected by Aurelian
and afterwards repaired by Honorius at dates respectively
260 and 130 years before the entry of
Belisarius. Time and barbarian sieges had wrought
much havoc on the line of defence, the work of repair
had to be done in haste, and to this day some
archaeologists think that it is possible to recognise
the parts repaired by Belisarius through the rough
style of the work and the heterogeneous nature of
the materials employed in it. All through the winter
months his ships were constantly arriving with cargoes
of corn from Sicily, which were safely stored
away in the great State-warehouses. These preparations
were viewed with dismay by the citizens, who
had fondly imagined that their troubles were over
when the Gothic soldiers marched forth by the
Porta Flaminia; that any fighting which might follow
would take place on some distant field, and that
they would have nothing to do but calmly to await
the issue of the combat. This, however, was by no
means the general's idea of the right way of playing
the game. He knew that the Goths immensely outnumbered
his forces; he knew also that they were
of old bad besiegers of cities, the work of siege
requiring a degree of patience and scientific skill to
which the barbarian nature could not attain; and his
<a name="p328" id="p328"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 328</span>
plan was to wear them down by compelling them to
undertake a long and wearisome blockade before he
tried conclusions with them in the open field. If the
Roman clergy and people had known that this was
in his thoughts, they would probably not have been
so ready to welcome the eagles of the Emperor into
their city.</p>

<p>Some hint of the growing disaffection of the Roman
people was carried to Ravenna and quickened
the impatience of Witigis, who was now eager to
retrieve the blunder which he had committed in the
evacuation of Rome. He marched southward with
a large army, which is represented to us as consisting
of 150,000 men, and in the early days of
March he was already at the other end of the Milvian
Bridge,<a id="footnotetag147" name="footnotetag147"></a>
<a href="#footnote147"><sup class="sml">147</sup></a> about two miles from Rome. Belisarius had meant to dispute the passage of the Tiber
at this point. The fort on the Tuscan side of the
river was garrisoned, and a large body of soldiers
was encamped on the Roman side; but when the
garrison of the fort saw the vast multitude of the
enemy, who at sunset pitched their tents upon the
plain, they despaired of making a successful resistance,
and abandoning the fort under cover of the
night, skulked off into the country districts of
Latium. Thus one point of the game was thrown
away. Next morning the Goths finding their passage
unopposed, marched quietly over the bridge
and fell upon the Roman camp. A desperate battle
followed, in which Belisarius, exposing himself more
than a general should have done, did great deeds of
<a name="p329" id="p329"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 329</span>
valour. He was mounted on a noble steed, dark
roan, with a white star on its forehead, which the
barbarians, from that mark on its brow, called
"Balan". Some Imperial soldiers who had deserted
to the enemy knew the steed and his rider, and
shouted to their comrades to aim all their darts at
Balan. So the cry "Balan!" "Balan!" resounded
through the Gothic ranks, and though only imperfectly
understood by many of the utterers, had the
effect of concentrating the fight round Belisarius and
the dark-roan steed. The general was nobly protected
by the picked troops which formed his guard.
They fell by scores around him, but he himself, desperately
fighting, received never a wound, though a
thousand of the noblest Goths lay dead in the narrow
space of ground where this Homeric combat
had been going forward. The Imperialists not
merely withstood the Gothic onset, but drove their
opponents back to their camp, which had been
already erected on the Roman bank of the Tiber.
Fresh troops, especially of cavalry, issuing forth
from thence turned the tide of battle, and, overborne
by irresistible numbers, Belisarius and his
soldiers were soon in full flight towards Rome.
When they arrived under the walls, with the barbarians
so close behind them that they seemed to
form one raging multitude, they found the gates
closed against them by the panic-stricken garrison.
Even Belisarius in vain shouted his orders to open
the gates; in his gory face and dust-stained figure
the defenders did not recognise their brilliant leader.
A halt was called, a desperate charge was made upon
<a name="p330" id="p330"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 330</span>
the pursuing Goths, who were already beginning to
pour down into the fosse; they were pushed back
some distance, not far, but far enough to enable the
Imperialists to reform their ranks, to make the presence
of the general known to the defenders on the
walls, to have the gates opened, and in some sort of
military order to enter the city. Thus the sun set on
Rome beleaguered, the barbarians outside the City.
Belisarius with his gallant band of soldiers thinned
but not disheartened by the struggle, within its
walls, and the citizens--</p>

<p>Of the great Siege of Rome, which began on that
day, early in March, 537, and lasted a year and nine
days, till March, 538, a siege perhaps the most
memorable of all that "Roma Æterna" has seen
and has groaned under, as part of the penalty of
her undying greatness, it will be impossible here to
give even a meagre outline. The events of those
wonderful 374 days are chronicled almost with the
graphic minuteness of a Kinglake by a man whom
we may call the literary assessor of Belisarius, the
rhetorician Procopius of Cæsarea. One or two incidents
of the siege may be briefly noticed here, and
then we must hasten onwards to its close.</p>

<p>Owing to the vast size of Rome not even the
host of the Goths was able to accomplish a complete
blockade of the City. They formed seven camps
six on the left and one on the right bank of
the Tiber, and they obstructed eight out of its four
<a name="p331" id="p331"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 331</span>
teen gates; but while the east and south sides of
the City were thus pretty effectually blockaded, there
were large spaces in the western circuit by which it
was tolerably easy for Belisarius to receive reinforcements,
to bring in occasional convoys of provisions,
and to send away non-combatants who diminished
his resisting power. One of the hardest blows
dealt by the barbarians was their severance of the
eleven great aqueducts from which Rome received
its water. This privation of an element so essential
to the health and comfort of the Roman under the
Empire (who resorted to the bath as a modern
Italian resorts to the café or the music hall), was felt
as a terrible blow by all classes, and wrought a lasting
change, and not a beneficial one, in the habits of the
citizens, and in the sanitary condition of Rome. It
also seemed likely to have an injurious effect on the
food supply of the City, since the mills in which
corn was ground for the daily rations of the people
were turned by water-power derived from the
Aqueduct of Trajan. Belisarius, however, always
fertile in resource, a man who, had he lived in the
nineteenth century, would assuredly have been a
great engineer, contrived to make Father Tiber
grind out the daily supply of flour for his Roman
children. He moored two barges in the narrowest
part of the stream, where the current was the strongest,
put his mill-stones on board of them, and hung a
water-wheel between them to turn his mills. These
river water-mills continued to be used on the Tiber
all through the Middle Ages, and even until they
were superseded by the introduction of steam.</p>

<a name="p332" id="p332"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 332</span>

<p>The Goths did not resign themselves to the slow
languors of a blockade till they had made one vigorous
and confident attempt at a storm. On the
eighteenth day of the siege the terrified Romans
saw from their windows the mighty armament approaching
the City. A number of wooden towers as
high as the walls, mounted on wheels, and drawn by
the stout oxen of Etruria, moved menacingly forward
amid the triumphant shouts of the barbarians,
each of whom had a bundle of boughs and reeds
under his arm ready to be thrown into the fosse, and
so prepare a level surface upon which the terrible
engines might approach the walls. To resist this
attack Belisarius had prepared a large number of
<i>Balistæ</i> (gigantic cross-bows worked by machinery
and discharging a short wedge-like bolt with such
force as to break trees or stones) had planted on
the walls, great slings, which the soldiers called
Wild Asses (<i>Onagri</i>), and had set in each gate the
deadly machine known as the Wolf, and which was
a kind of double portcullis, worked both from above
and from below.</p>

<p>But though the Gothic host was approaching
with its threatening towers close to the walls, Belisarius
would not give the signal, and not a <i>Balista</i>,
nor a Wild Ass was allowed to hurl its missiles against
the foe. He only laughed aloud, and bade the soldiers
do nothing till he gave the word of command. To
the citizens this seemed an evil jest, and they
grumbled aloud at the impudence of the general
who chose this moment of terrible suspense for merriment.
But now when the Goths were close to the
<a name="p333" id="p333"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 333</span>
fosse, Belisarius lifted his bow, singled out a mail-clad
chief, and sent an arrow through his neck, inflicting
a deadly wound. A great shout of triumph
rose from the Imperial soldiers as the proudly
accoutred barbarian rolled in the dust. Another
shot, another Gothic chief slain, and again a shout
of triumph. Then the signal to shoot was given to
the soldiers, and hundreds of bolts from Wild Ass
and <i>Balista</i> were hurtling through the air, aimed not
at Gothic soldiers, but at the luckless oxen that drew
the ponderous towers. The beasts being slain, it was
impossible for the Goths who were immediately under
the walls and exposed to a deadly discharge of arrows
from the battlements, to move their towers either
backward or forward, and there they remained mere
laughing-stocks in their huge immobility, till the end
of the day, when they with all the rest of the Gothic
enginery were given as a prey to the flames. Then
men understood the meaning of the laughter of
Belisarius as he watched the preparations of the
barbarians and derided their childish simplicity in
supposing that he would allow them calmly to move
up their towers till they touched his wall, without
using his artillery to cripple their advance.</p>

<p>Though the attack with the towers had thus failed
there was still fierce fighting to be done on the south-east
and north-west of the City. At the Prænestine
Gate (<i>Porta Maggiore</i>), that noble structure which is
formed out of the arcades of the Aqueducts, there
was a desperate onslaught of the barbarians, which
at one time seemed likely to be successful, but a
sudden sortie of Belisarius taking them in their rear
<a name="p334" id="p334"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 334</span>
turned them to headlong flight. In the opposite
quarter the Aurelian Gate was commanded by the
mighty tomb-fortress then known as the Mausoleum
of Hadrian, and now, in its dismantled and degraded
state, as the Castle of Sant'Angelo. Here the
peculiar shape of the fortress prevented the defenders
from using their <i>Balistæ</i> with proper effect
on the advancing foe, and when the besiegers were
close under the walls the bolts from the engines flew
over their heads. It seemed as if, after all, by the
Aurelian Gate the barbarians would enter Rome,
when, by a happy instinct, the garrison turned to the
marble statues which surrounded the tomb, wrenched
them from their bases, and rained down such a terrible
shower of legs and arms and heads of gods and
goddesses on their barbarian assailants that these
soon fled in utter confusion.</p>

<p>The whole result of this great day of assault was
to convince Witigis and his counsellors that the City
could not be taken in that manner, and that the
siege must be turned into a blockade. A general
sally which Belisarius ordered, against his better
judgment, in order to still the almost mutinous
clamours of his troops, and which took place about
the fiftieth day of the siege, proved almost as disastrous
for the Romans as the assault had done for
the Goths. It was manifest that this was not a
struggle which could be ended by a single blow on
either side. All the miseries of a long siege must
be endured both by attackers and attacked, and the
only question was on which side patience would first
give way--whether the Romans under roofs, but
<a name="p335" id="p335"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 335</span>
short of provisions, or the Goths better fed, but
encamped on the deadly Campagna, would be the
first to succumb to hunger and disease.</p>

<p>Witigis had been in his day a brave soldier, but
he evidently knew nothing of the art of war. He
allowed Belisarius to disencumber himself of many
useless consumers of food by sending the women,
the children, and the slaves out of the City. His
attention was disturbed by feigned attacks, when
the reinforcements, which were tardily sent by
Justinian, and the convoys of provisions, which had
been collected by the wife of Belisarius, the martial
Antonina, were to be brought within the walls.
And, lastly, when at length, about the ninth month
of the siege, he proposed a truce and the reopening
of negotiations with Constantinople, he did not even
insert in the conditions of the truce any limit to the
quantity of supplies which under its cover the Imperialists
might introduce into the City. Thus he
played the game of his wily antagonist, and abandoned
all the advantages--and they were not many--which
the nine months of blockade had won for
him.</p>

<p>The parleyings which preceded this truce have an
especial interest for us, whose forefathers were at
this very time engaged in making England their
own. The Goths, after complaining that Justinian
had broken the solemn compact made between Zeno
and Theodoric as to the conquest of Italy from
Odovacar, went on to propose terms of compromise.
"They were willing", they said, "for the sake of
peace to give up Sicily, that large and wealthy island,
<a name="p336" id="p336"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 336</span>
so important to a ruler who had now become master
of Africa". Belisarius answered with sarcastic courtesy:
"Such great benefits should be repaid in
kind. We will concede to the Goths the possession
of the whole island of Britain, which is much larger
than Sicily, and which was once possessed by the
Romans as Sicily was once possessed by the Goths".
Of course that country, though much larger than
Sicily, was one the possession of which was absolutely
unimportant to the Emperor and his general.
"What mattered it", they might well say, "who
owned that misty and poverty-stricken island. The
oysters of Rutupiæ, some fine watch-dogs from Caledonia,
a little lead from the Malvern Hills, and some
cargoes of corn and wool--this was all that the Empire
had ever gained from her troublesome conquest.
Even in the world of mind Britain had done nothing
more than give birth to one second-rate heretic.

<p>The truce, as will be easily understood, brought
no alleviation to the sufferings of the Goths, who
were now almost more besieged than besiegers, and
who were dying by thousands in the unhealthy
Campagna. Before the end of March, 538, they
broke up their encampment, and marched, in sullen
gloom, northwards to defend Ravenna, which was
already being threatened by the operations of a
lieutenant of Belisarius. The 150,000 men who had
hastened to Rome, dreading lest the Imperialists
<a name="p337" id="p337"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 337</span>
should escape before they could encompass the City,
were reduced to but a small portion of that number,
perhaps not many more than the 10,000 which, after
all his reinforcements had been received, seems to
have been the greatest number of actual soldiers
serving under Belisarius in the defence of Rome.</p>

<p>I pass rapidly over the events of 538 and 539.
The Imperial generals pressed northwards along the
Flaminian Way. Urbino, Rimini, Osimo, and other
cities in this region were taken by them. But the
Goths fought hard, though they gave little proof of
strategic skill; and once, when they recaptured the
great city of Milan, it looked as though they might
almost be about to turn the tide of conquest. Evidently
they were far less demoralised by their past
prosperity than the Vandals. Perhaps also the
Roman population of Italy, who had met with
far gentler and more righteous treatment from the
Ostrogoths than their compeers in Africa had met
with from the Vandals, and who were now suffering
the horrors of famine, owing to the operations of
the contending armies, assisted the operations of the
Byzantine invaders less than the Roman provincials
in Africa had done. Whatever the cause, it was not
till the early months of 540, nearly five years after the
beginning of the war, that Belisarius and his army
stood before the walls and among the rivers of Ravenna,
almost the last stronghold of Witigis. Belisarius
blockaded the city, and his blockade was a far
more stringent one than that which Witigis had drawn
around Rome. Still there was the ancient and well-founded
reputation for impregnability of the great
<a name="p338" id="p338"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 338</span>
Adrian city, and, moreover, just at this time the
ambassadors, sent by Witigis to Justinian, returned
from Constantinople, bearing the Emperor's consent
to a compromise. Italy, south of the Po, was to
revert to the Empire; north of that river, the Goths
were still to hold it, and the royal treasure was to
be equally divided between the two states. Belisarius
called a council of war, and all his officers
signed a written opinion "that the proposals of the
Emperor were excellent, and that no better terms
could be obtained from the Barbarians". This, however,
was by no means the secret thought of Belisarius,
who had set his heart on taking Witigis as a captive
to Constantinople, and laying the keys of Ravenna
at his master's feet. A strange proposition which
came from the beleaguered city seemed to open the
way to the accomplishment of his purpose. The
Gothic nobles suggested that he, the great Captain,
whose might in war they had experienced, should
become their leader, should mount the throne of
Theodoric, and should be crowned "King of the
Italians and Goths", the change in the order of the
names indicating the subordinate position which the
humbled barbarians were willing to assume. Belisarius
seemed to acquiesce in the proposal (though his
secretary assures us that he never harboured a
thought of disloyalty to his master), and received the
oath of the Gothic envoys for the surrender of the
city, postponing his own coronation-oath to his new
subjects till he could swear it in the presence of
Witigis and all his nobles, for Witigis, too, was a
consenting, nay, an eager, party to the transaction.
<a name="p339" id="p339"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 339</span>
Thus, by an act of dissimulation, which brought
some stain on his knightly honour (we are tempted
to use the language of chivalry in speaking of these
events), but which left no stain on his loyalty to the
Emperor of Rome, did Belisarius obtain possession
of the impregnable Ravenna. He marched in, he
and his veterans, into the famine-stricken city.
When the Gothic women saw the little dark men
filing past them through the streets, and contrasted
them with their own long-limbed, flaxen-haired
giants, they spat in the faces of their husbands, and
said: "Are you men, to have allowed yourselves to
be beaten by such manikins as these?"</p>

<p>Before the triumphal entry was finished the
Goths had no doubt discovered that they were
duped. No coronation oath was sworn. Belisarius,
still the humble servant of Justinianus Augustus, did
not allow himself to be raised on the shield and
saluted as King of the Italians and Goths. The
Gothic warriors were kindly treated, but dismissed
to their farms between the Apennines and the
Adriatic. Ravenna was again an Imperial city, and
destined to remain so for two centuries. Witigis,
with his wife and children, were carried captives to
Constantinople where, before many years were over,
the dethroned monarch died. His widow, Matasuentha,
was soon remarried to Germanus, the nephew
of Justinian, and thus the granddaughter of Theodoric
obtained that position as a great lady of
Byzantium which was far more gratifying to her
taste than the rude royalty of Ravenna.</p>

<p>There is one more personage whose subsequent
<a name="p340" id="p340"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 340</span>
fortunes must be briefly glanced at here. Cassiodorus,
the minister of Theodoric and Amalasuentha,
remained, as we regret to find, in the service of
Theodahad when sole king and composed his stilted
sentences at the bidding of Amalasuentha's murderer.
Witigis also employed him to write his address to
his subjects on ascending the throne. He does not
seem to have taken any part in the siege of Rome,
and before the tide of war rolled back upon Ravenna,
he had withdrawn from public affairs. He retired to
his native town, Squillace, high up on the Calabrian
hills, and there founded a monastery and a hermitage
in the superintendence of which his happy years
glided on till he died, having nearly completed a century
of life. His was one of the first and greatest of the
literary monasteries which, by perpetuating copies of
the Scriptures, and the Greek and Roman classics,
have conferred so great a boon on posterity. When
Ceolfrid, the Abbot of Jarrow, would offer to the
Holy Father at Rome a most priceless gift, he sent
the far-famed Codex Amiatinus, a copy of the Vulgate,
made by a disciple of Cassiodorus, if not by
Cassiodorus himself.</p>

<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/054.png">ith the fall of Ravenna, and the
captivity of King Witigis, it
seemed as if the chapter of
Ostrogothic dominion in Italy
was ended. In fact, however, the
war was prolonged for a further
period of thirteen years, a time
glorious for the Goths, disgraceful
for the Empire, full of lamentation
and woe for the unhappy
country which was to be the prize of victory.</p>

<p>The departure of Belisarius, summoned to the
East by his master in order to conduct another
<a name="p342" id="p342"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 342</span>
Persian war, left the newly won provinces on an in
cline sloping downwards to anarchy. Of all the generals
who remained behind, brave and capable men as
some of them were, there was none who possessed
the unquestioned ascendancy of Belisarius, either in
genius or character. Each thought himself as good
as the others: there was no subordination, no hearty
co-operation towards a common end, but instead of
these necessary conditions of success there was an
eager emulation in the race towards wealth, and in
this ignoble contest the unhappy "Roman", the
Italian landholder, for whose sake, nominally, the
Gothic war was undertaken, found himself pillaged
and trampled upon as he had never been by the
most brutal of the barbarians.</p>

<p>Nor were the military officers the only offenders.
A swarm of civil servants flew westwards from
Byzantium and lighted on the unhappy country.
Their duty was to extort money by any and all
means for their master, their pleasure to accumulate
fortunes for themselves; but whether the <i>logothete</i>
plundered for the Emperor or for himself, the Italian
tax-payer equally had the life-blood sucked from his
veins. Even the soldiers by whom the marvellous
victories of the last five years had been won, found
themselves at the mercy of this hateful bureaucracy;
arrears of pay left undischarged, fines inflicted, everything
done to force upon their embittered souls the
reflection that they had served a mean and ungrateful
master.</p>

<p>Of all these oppressors of Italy none was more
justly abhorred than Alexander the Logothete.
<a name="p343" id="p343"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 343</span>
This man, who was placed at the head of the financial
administration, and who seems by virtue of that
position to have been practically supreme in all but
military operations, had been lifted from a very
humble sphere to eminence, from poverty to boundless
wealth, but the one justification which he could
always offer for his self-advancement was this, that
no one else had been so successful as he in filling the
coffers of his master. The soldiers were, by his proceedings
against them, reduced to a poor, miserable,
and despised remnant. The Roman inhabitants of
Italy, especially the nobles, found that he hunted up
with wonderful keenness and assiduity, and enforced
with relentless sternness all the claims--and they
were probably not a few--which the easy-tempered
Gothic kings had suffered to lapse. In their simplicity
these nobles may have imagined that they
could plead that they were serving the Emperor by
withholding contributions from the barbarian. Not
so, however. Theodoric, now that his dynasty had
been overthrown, became again a legitimate ruler, and
Justinian as his heir would exact to the uttermost
his unclaimed rights. The nature of the grasping
logothete was well-known in his own country, and the
Byzantines, using the old Greek weapon of satire
against an unpopular ruler, called him "Alexander
the Scissors", declaring that there was no one so
clever as he in clipping the gold coins of the currency
without impairing their roundness.</p>

<p>The result of all these oppressions and this misgovernment
was to raise up in a marvellous manner
the Gothic standard from the dust into which it had
<a name="p344" id="p344"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 344</span>
fallen. When Belisarius left Italy, only one city
still remained to the Goths, the strong city of
Ticinum, which is now known as Pavia, and which,
from its magnificent position at the angle of the
Ticino and the Po, was often in the early Middle
Ages the last stronghold to be surrendered in Northwestern
Italy. Here had the Goths chosen one of
their nobles, Ildibad, for their king, but the new king
had but one thousand soldiers under him, and his
might well seem a desperate cause. Before the end of
540, however, the departure of Belisarius, the wrangling
among his successors, the oppressions of Alexander
the Logothete, the disaffection of the ruined
soldiery had completely changed the face of affairs.
An army of considerable size, consisting in great
measure of deserters from the Imperial standard,
obeyed the orders of Ildibad; he won a great pitched
battle near Treviso over Vitalius, the best of the
Imperial generals, and the whole of Italy north of the
Po again owned the sway of the Gothic king.</p>

<p>Internal feuds delayed for a little time the revival
of the strength of the barbarians. There was strife
between Ildibad and the family of the deposed
Witigis, and this strife led to Ildibad's assassination
and to the election of an utterly incapable successor,
Eraric the Rugian. But in the autumn of 541 all these
domestic discords were at an end; Eraric had been
slain, and the nephew of Ildibad was the universally
recognised king of the Ostrogoths. This man, who
was destined to reign for eleven years, twice to stand
as conqueror within the walls of Rome, to bring
back almost the whole of Italy under the dominion
<a name="p345" id="p345"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 345</span>
of his people, to be in a scarcely lower degree than
Theodoric himself the hero and champion of
the Ostrogothic race, was the young and gallant
Totila.<a id="footnotetag149" name="footnotetag149"></a>
<a href="#footnote149"><sup class="sml">149</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote149"
name="footnote149"></a><b>Footnote 149:</b><a href="#footnotetag149">
(return) </a> This is the form of the name which was known to the Greek writers, and which is now irrevocably accepted by history. It is clear, however, from his coins that the new king called himself Baduila, and we cannot certainly say that he ever accepted the other designation.</blockquote>

<p>With true statesmanlike instinct the new king perceived
that the cause of the past failure of the Goths
lay in the alienated affections of the people of Italy.
The greater misgovernment of the Emperor's servants,
the coldly calculating rapacity of Alexander the
Scissors, and the arrogant injustice of the generals,
terrible only to the weak, had given him a chance of
winning back the love of the Italian people and of
restoring that happy state of things which prevailed
after the downfall of Odovacar, when all classes,
nobles and peasants, Goths and Romans, joined in
welcoming Theodoric as their king. Totila therefore
kept a strong hand upon his soldiers, sternly repressed
all plundering and outrage, and insisted on the
peasants being paid for all the stores which the
army needed on its march. One day a Roman
inhabitant of Calabria came before him to complain
of one of the king's life-guardsmen who had committed
an outrage upon his daughter. The guardsman,
not denying the charge, was at once put in
ward. Then the most influential nobles assembled
at the king's tent, and besought him not to punish a
brave and capable soldier for such an offence. Totila
<a name="p346" id="p346"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 346</span>
replied that he mourned as much as they could do
over the necessity of taking away the life of one
of his countrymen, but that the common good,
the safety of the nation, required this sacrifice. At
the outset of the war they had all the wealth of Italy
and countless brave hearts at their disposal, but all
these advantages had availed them nothing because
they had an unjust king, Theodahad, at their head.
Now the Divine favour on their righteous cause
seemed to be giving them the victory, but only by a
continuance in righteous deeds could they hope to
secure it. With these words he won over even the
interceding Goths to his opinion. The guardsman
was sentenced to death, and his goods were confiscated
for the benefit of the maiden whom he had wronged.</p>

<p>At the same time that Totila showed himself thus
gentle and just towards the Roman inhabitants, he
skilfully conducted the war so as to wound the Empire
in its tenderest part--finance. Justinian's aim,
in Italy as in Africa, was to make the newly annexed
territory pay its own expenses and hand over a good
balance to the Imperial treasury. It was for this
purpose that the logothetes had been let loose upon
Italy--that the provincials had been maddened by
the extortions of the tax-gatherer, that the soldiers
had been driven to mutiny and defection. Now
with his loyal and well disciplined troops, Totila
moved over the country from the Alps to Calabria,
quietly collecting the taxes claimed by the Emperor
and the rents due to the refugee landlords, and in
this way, without oppressing the people, weakened
<a name="p347" id="p347"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 347</span>
the Imperial government and put himself in a position
to pay liberally for the commissariat of his
army. Thus the difficulties of the Imperial treasury
increased. Justinian became more and more unwilling
to loosen his purse-strings for the sake of a
province which showed an ever-dwindling return.
The pay of the soldiers got more and more hopelessly
into arrear. They deserted in increasing
numbers to the standard of the brave and generous
young king of the Goths. Hence, it came to pass,
that in the spring of 544, when Totila had been only
for two and a half years king, he had gained two
pitched battles by land and one by sea, had taken
Naples and Beneventum, could march freely from one
end of Italy to the other, and in fact, with the exception
of Ravenna, Rome, and a few other strongholds,
had won back from the Empire the whole of
that Italy which had been acquired with so much toil
and so much bloodshed.</p>

<p>There was, of course, bitter disappointment in the
council-chamber of Justinian at this issue of an
enterprise which had seemed at first so successful.
There was but one sentence on all men's lips--"Only
Belisarius can recover Italy", and it was
uttered so loudly and so universally, that the Emperor
could not but hear it. But Justinian, ever
since the offer of the Western throne to Belisarius,
seems to have looked upon him with jealousy as a
possible rival, and (what was even more fatal to his
interests at court), the Empress Theodora had come
to regard him with dislike and suspicion, partly
because of a domestic quarrel in which she had
<a name="p348" id="p348"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 348</span>
taken the part of his wife Antonina against him, and
partly because when Justinian was lying plague-stricken
and apparently at the point of death, Belisarius
had discussed the question of the succession
to the throne in a manner which the Empress
considered hostile to her interests. For these
reasons the great general had been for some years
in disgrace. A large part of his property was
taken away from him, and some of it was handed
over to Antonina, with whom he had been ordered
to reconcile himself on the most humbling terms:
his great military household, containing many men
of servile origin, whom he had trained to such
deeds of valour that it was a common saying, "One
household alone has destroyed the kingdom of Theodoric",
was broken up, and those brave men who
would willingly have died for their chief, were portioned
out by lot among the other generals and the
eunuchs of the palace.</p>

<p>Still, in deference to the unanimous opinion of his
counsellors, Justinian decided once more to avail
himself of the services of Belisarius for the reconquest
of Italy. But his unquenched jealousy of his
great general's fame, and the almost bankrupt condition
of the Imperial exchequer converged to the
same point, and caused Justinian, while entrusting
Belisarius with the command, to couple with it the
monstrous stipulation that he was not to ask for any
money for the war. And this, though it was clear to
all men that the want of money and the consequent
desertion of the Imperial standard by whole companies
of grumbling barbarians, had been one main
<a name="p349" id="p349"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 349</span>
cause of the amazing success of Totila. Thus crippled
by his master, and having his own spirit broken
by Imperial ingratitude and domestic unhappiness,
Belisarius, in the whole course of his second command
in Italy, which lasted for five years--(544-549) did
nothing, or I should rather say only one thing, worthy
of his former reputation. This is the judgment
which his former friend and admirer, Procopius,
passes on this period of his life. "Thus then", (in
549) "Belisarius departed to Byzantium without
glory, having been for five years in Italy, but having
never been strong enough to make a regular march
by land in all that time, but having flitted about
from one fortress on the coast to another, and so
left the enemy free to capture Rome and almost
every other place which they attacked".</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this harsh sentence, it was in
connection with the siege of Rome that the old
Belisarius, the man of infinite resource and courageous
dexterity, once more revealed himself, and
while we gladly let all the other events of these five
tedious years glide into oblivion, it is worth while
devoting a few pages to the Second and Third Gothic
sieges of Rome.</p>

<p>Totila had quite determined not to repeat the
mistake of Witigis, by dashing his army to pieces
against the walls of Rome, but, for all that, he could
not feel his recovery of Italy to be complete so long
as the Eternal City defied his power. He therefore
slowly tightened his grasp on the City, capturing
one town after another in its neighbourhood and
watching the roads to prevent convoys of provisions
<a name="p350" id="p350"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 350</span>
from entering it. He was on good terms with the
peasants of the surrounding country, paid liberally
for all the provisions required by his army (far
smaller than that of Witigis), and kept his soldiers
in good heart and in high health, while the unhappy
citizens were seeing the great enemy--Famine--slowly
approach nearer and nearer to their homes.</p>

<p>Within the City there was now no such provident
and resourceful general as Belisarius. Bessas, the
commandant, himself an Ostrogoth of Mœsia by
birth, was a brave man, but coarse, selfish, and unfeeling.
Intent only on filling his own coffers by
selling the corn which he had stored up in his warehouses
at a famine-price to the citizens, he was not
touched by the increasing misery around him, and
made no effectual attempt to break the net which
Totila had drawn round Rome. Belisarius himself,
"flitting from point to point of the coast", had come
to Portus eighteen miles from Rome, at the mouth
of the Tiber. It was no want of good-will on his
part that prevented him from bringing his provision-ships
up the river to the help of the famished City,
but about four miles above Portus Totila had placed
a strong boom of timber, protected in front by an
iron chain and guarded by two towers, one at each
end of the bridge which was above the boom. Belisarius
made his preparations for destroying the
boom: a floating tower as high as the bridge placed
on two barges, a large vessel filled with "Greek fire"
at the top of the tower, soldiers below to hew the
boom in pieces and sever the chain, a long train of
merchantmen behind laden with provisions for the
<a name="p351" id="p351"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 351</span>
hungry Romans, and manned by archers who poured
a deadly volley of arrows on the defenders of the
bridge. All went well with his design up to a certain
point. The chain was severed, the Goths fell fast
under the arrows from the ships, the vessel of
"Greek fire" was hurled upon one of the forts,
which was soon wrapped in flames. With might
and main the Imperial soldiers began to hack at the
boom, and it seemed as if in a few minutes the
corn-laden vessels would be sailing up the Tiber,
bringing glad relief to the starving citizens. But
just at that moment a horseman galloped up to
Belisarius with the unwelcome tidings--"Isaac is
taken prisoner". Isaac the Armenian was Belisarius'
second in command, whom he had left at Portus in
charge of his stores, his munitions of war, and
most important of all, the now reconciled Antonina.
In spite of Belisarius' strict injunction to act solely
on the defensive, Isaac, watching from afar the successful
movements of his chief, had sallied forth to
attack the Gothic garrison at Ostia on the opposite
bank of the river. His defeat and consequent capture
were events of little moment in themselves, but
all-important as arresting the victorious career of
Belisarius. For to the anxious soul of the general
the capture of Isaac seemed to mean the capture of
Portus, the cutting off of his army from their base
of operations, the captivity of his beloved Antonina.
He gave the signal for retreat; the attempt to provision
Rome had failed; the Imperial army returned
to Portus. When he found what it was that had
really happened, and by what a combination of
<a name="p352" id="p352"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 352</span>
folly and ill luck he had been prevented from winning
a splendid victory, his annoyance was so great
that combined with the unwholesome air of the
Campagna it threw him into a fever which brought
him near to death and prevented him for some
months from taking any part in the war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile dire famine bore sway in the beleaguered
city. Wheat was sold for Â£22 a quarter, and the
greater part of the citizens were thankful to live on
coarse bread made of bran, which was doled out to
them by Bessas at a quarter of the price of wheat.
Before long even this bran became a luxury beyond
their power to purchase. Dogs and mice provided
them with their only meals of flesh, but the staple
article of food was nettles. With blackened skin
and drawn faces, mere ghosts of their former selves,
the once proud and prosperous citizens of Rome
wandered about the waste places where these nettles
grew, and often one of them would be found dead
with hunger, his strength having suddenly failed him
while attempting to gather his wretched meal.</p>

<p>At length this misery was suddenly ended. Some
Isaurian soldiers who were guarding the Asinarian
Gate in the south-east of the City made overtures to
the Gothic soldiers for the betrayal of their post.
These Isaurians were probably part of the former
garrison of Naples whom Totila had treated with
great generosity after the surrender of that city.
They remembered the kindness then shown them;
they were weary of the siege, and disgusted with
the selfish avarice of their generals, and they soon
came to terms with the besiegers. Four of the
<a name="p353" id="p353"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 3534</span>
bravest Goths being hoisted over the walls at night
by the friendly Isaurians, ran round to the Asinarian
Gate, battered its bolts and bars to pieces, and let
in their waiting comrades. Unopposed, the Gothic
army marched in,<a id="footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a>
<a href="#footnote150"><sup class="sml">150</sup></a> unresisting, the Imperial troops
marched out by the Flaminian Gate. The play was
precisely the same that had been enacted ten years
before when Belisarius won the city from Leudaris,
but with the parts reversed. What Witigis with his
one hundred and fifty thousand Goths had failed to
accomplish, an army of not more than a tenth of that
number<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a>
<a href="#footnote151"><sup class="sml">151</sup></a> had accomplished under Totila. Bessas
and the other generals fled headlong with the rest
of the crowd that pressed out of the Flaminian Gate,
and the treasure, accumulated with such brutal disregard
of human suffering, fell into the hands of the
besiegers.</p>

<p>At first murder and plunder raged unchecked
through the streets of the City, the exasperation
which had been caused by the events of the long
siege having made every Gothic heart bitter against
Rome and Romans. But after sixty citizens had
been slain, Totila, who had gone to St. Peter's to
offer up his prayers and thanksgivings, listened to
the intercession of the deacon Pelagius<a id="footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a>
<a href="#footnote152"><sup class="sml">152</sup></a> and commanded
<a name="p354" id="p354"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 354</span>
that slaughter should cease. But there were
only five hundred citizens left in Rome to receive
the benefit of the amnesty, so great had been the
depopulation of the City by war and famine.<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a>

<p>And now had come a fateful moment in the history
of Roma Æterna. A conqueror stood within her
walls, not in mere joyousness of heart like Alaric,
pleased with the exploit of bringing to her knees the
mistress of the world, not intent on vulgar plans of
plunder like Gaiseric, but nourishing a deep and
deadly hatred against that false and ungrateful City,
and, by the ghosts of a hundred and fifty thousand
of his countrymen who had died before her untaken
walls, beckoned on a memorable revenge. Totila
would spare, as he had promised, the lives of the
trembling citizens, but he had determined that Rome
herself should perish. The walls should be dismantled,
the public buildings burned to the ground,
and sheep should graze again over the seven hills of
the City as they had grazed thirteen hundred years
before, when Romulus and Remus were suckled by
the wolf. From this purpose, however, he was
moved by the intercession of Belisarius, who, from
his couch of fever, wrote a spirit-stirring letter to
Totila, pleading for Rome, greatest and most glorious
of all cities that the sun looked down upon, the work
not of one king nor one century, but of long ages
and many generations of noble men. Belisarius concluded
with an appeal to the Gothic king to consider
<a name="p355" id="p355"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 355</span>
what should be his own eternal record in history,
whether he would rather be remembered as the preserver
or the destroyer of the greatest city in the
world.</p>

<p>This appeal, made by one hero to another, was
successful. Totila was still bent on preventing the
City from ever again becoming a stronghold of the
enemy, and therefore determined to lay one-third of
the walls level with the ground, but he assured the
messengers of Belisarius that he would leave the
great monuments of Rome untouched. Having
accomplished the needed demolition of her defences,
he marched forth with his army from the desolate and
sepulchral City and took up a position in the Alban
Mountains, which are seen by the dwellers in Rome
far off on their south-eastern horizon.</p>

<p>When Totila withdrew Rome was left, we are
told, absolutely devoid of inhabitants.<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a>
<a href="#footnote154"><sup class="sml">154</sup></a> The Senators
he kept in his camp as hostages, and all the less
influential citizens with their wives and children
were sent away to the confines of Campania. For
forty days or more the great City which had been for
so long the heart of the human universe, the city
<a name="p356" id="p356"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 356</span>
which, with the million-fold tide of life throbbing in
her veins, had most vividly prefigured the London
of our own day, remained "waste and without inhabitants",
as desolate as Anderida in Kent had been left half a century before by her savage Saxon conquerors.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote154"
name="footnote154"></a><b>Footnote 154:</b><a href="#footnotetag154">
(return) </a> As the passage is an important one I will give a literal translation
of the words of Procopius ("De Bell. Gotthico", iii., 22): "Of the Romans, however, he kept the members of the Senate with him, but
sent away all the others with their wives and children to the regions bordering on Campania, having permitted not a single human being
to remain in Rome, but having left her absolutely desolate". (έν Ροόμη ανθρωπον ούδένα έάσας, άλλ́ έρημον αύτήν τό
παράπαν άπολιποόν.)

<p>The contemporary chronicler Marcellinus Comes confirms this
statement: "Post quam devastationem XL. aut amplius dies Roma
fuit ita desolata ut nemo ibi hominum nisi bestiæ morarentur".</p></blockquote>

<p>And then came another change--one of the most
marvellous in the history of that City whose whole
life has been a marvel. While Totila abode in his
camp on the Alban Hills, Belisarius, rising from the
bed to which fever had for so many weeks chained
him, made a visit to Rome, accompanied by a thousand
soldiers, that he might see with his own eyes
into what depth of calamity she had fallen. At first,
it would seem, mere curiosity led him to the ruined
City, but when he was there, gazing on Totila's work
of devastation, a brilliant thought flashed through
his brain. After all the demolitions of Totila, the
ruin was not irretrievable. By repairing the rents in
the walls, Rome might yet be made defensible. He
would re-occupy it, and the Goths should find that
they had all their work to do over again. The idea
seemed at first to his counsellors like the suggestion
of delirium, but as it rapidly took shape under his
hands, it was recognised as being indeed a masterstroke
of well-calculated audacity. Leaving a small
body of men to guard his base of operations at
Portus, he moved every available man to Rome,
crowded them up to the gaps made by Totila, bade
them build anyhow, with any sort of material--mortar
was out of the question; it must be mere dry
walling that they could accomplish,--only let them
<a name="p357" id="p357"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 357</span>
preserve some semblance of an upright wall, and
crown the summit of it with a rampart of stakes.
The deep fosse below fortunately remained as it was,
not filled up. So in five and twenty days the
circuit of the walls was completed, truly in a most
slovenly style of building, the marks of which we
can see even to this day, but Rome was once again
a "fenced city". As soon as Totila heard the unwelcome
tidings, he marched with his whole army to
Rome, hoping to take the City, as his soldiers said,
"at the first shout". But he had Belisarius to deal
with, not Bessas. There had not yet been time even
to make new gates for the City instead of those which
Totila had destroyed, but Belisarius planted all his
bravest soldiers in the void places where the gates
should be, and guarded the approach by caltrops
(somewhat like those wherewith Bruce defended his
line at Bannockburn), so as to make a charge of
Gothic cavalry impossible. Three long days of hard-fought
battle were spent round the fateful City. In
each the Goths, whatever temporary advantages they
might gain, were finally repulsed, and at length
Totila, who was not going to repeat the error of
Witigis, marched away from the too well-known
scene, amid the bitter reproaches of the Gothic
nobles, who before had praised him like a god for all
his valour and dexterity in war, but now, on the
morrow of his first great blunder, loudly upbraided
him for his imprudence, adding the obvious and easy
piece of Epimethean criticism, "that the City ought
either to have been utterly destroyed, or else occupied
with a sufficient force". Meanwhile Belisarius
<a name="p358" id="p358"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 358</span>
at his leisure completed the repair of the walls, hung
the massive gates on their hinges, had keys made
to fit their locks, and sent the duplicate keys to Justinian.
The Roman Empire once again had Rome.</p>

<p>And yet this re-occupation of the Eternal City,
brilliant and striking achievement as it was, had little
influence on the course of the war. Rome was now
like a great stone left in an alluvial plain showing
where the river had once flowed, but the currents of
commerce, of politics, of war, flowed now in other
channels. Belisarius, leaving a garrison in Rome,
had to betake himself once more to that desultory
warfare, flitting round the coast from one naval
fortress to another, in which the earlier years of his
second command had been passed; and at length,
early in 549, only two years after his re-occupation
of Rome, he obtained as a great favour, through the
intercession of Antonina, permission to resign his
command and return to Constantinople. It was on
this occasion that Procopius passed that harsh judgment
as to the inglorious character of these later
operations of his in Italy, which was quoted on a
previous page.<a id="footnotetag155" name="footnotetag155"></a>

<p>I will briefly summarise the subsequent events in
the life of the old hero:</p>

<p>Once more, ten years after the return of Belisarius
(in 559), his services were claimed by Justinian in
order to repel a horde of savage Huns who had
penetrated within eighteen miles of Constantinople.
The work was brilliantly done, with much of the old
ingenuity and fertility of resource which had marked
<a name="p359" id="p359"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 358</span>
his first campaign in Italy, and then Belisarius relapsed
into inactivity. He was again accused (562),
probably without justice, of abetting a conspiracy
against the Emperor, was disgraced and imprisoned
in his own palace. After seven months he was restored
to the Imperial favour, the falsity of the accusation
against him having probably become apparent.
He died in 565, in about the sixtieth year of his age,
and only a few months before his jealous master.
He had more than once had to endure the withdrawal
of that master's confidence, and some portions
of his vast wealth were on two occasions taken from
him. But this is all that can be truly said as to the
reverses of fortune undergone by the conqueror of
the Vandals and the Goths. The stories of his blindness
and of his beggary, of his holding forth a wooden
bowl and whining out "<i>Date obolum Belisario</i>", rest
on no good foundation, and either arise from a confusion
between Belisarius and another disgraced
minister of Justinian, or else are simply due to the
myth-making industry of the Middle Ages.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>


<h3>NARSES.</h3>

<p>Totila again takes Rome--High-water mark of the success of the
Gothic arms--Narses, the Emperor's Chamberlain, appointed to
command another expedition for the recovery of Italy--His
character--His semi-barbarous army--Enters Italy--Battle of the
Apennines--Totila slam--End of the Gothic dominion in Italy.</p>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/057.png">oon after the return of Belisarius to
Constantinople came the Fourth
Siege of Rome. Totila, who had
sought the hand of a Frankish
princess in marriage, received for
answer from her father, "that the
man who had not been able to
keep Rome when he had taken it,
but had destroyed part and abandoned
the rest to the enemy, was no King of Italy".<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a>
<a href="#footnote156"><sup class="sml">156</sup></a></p>



<p>The taunt stung Totila to the quick. We know not
<a name="p361" id="p361"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 361</span>
whether he won his Frankish bride or no, but he was
determined to win Rome. Assault again failing, he
occupied Portus and instituted a more rigorous
blockade than ever. But it had become a matter of
some difficulty to starve out the defenders of Rome,
for there were practically no citizens there, only a
garrison, for whose food the corn grown within the
enclosure of the walls was nearly sufficient. The
economic change from the days of the Empire thus
revealed to us is almost as great as if the harvests of
Hyde Park and Regent's Park sufficed to feed the
diminished population of London.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote156"
name="footnote156"></a><b>Footnote 156:</b><a href="#footnotetag156">
(return) </a> Procopius, "De Bello Gotthico", iii., 37. This is one of the passages which make me somewhat doubtful whether we are not too confident in our denial of the title "King of Italy" to Odovacar and Theodoric. The words are clear.</blockquote>

<p>There was, however, among the Imperial soldiers in
the garrison of Rome, as elsewhere, deep discontent,
amounting sometimes to mutiny, at the long withholding
of their arrears of pay; and the sight of the pomp
and splendour, which surrounded the former betrayer
of Rome when they rode in the ranks with Totila, was
too much for their Isaurian countrymen. The men
who kept watch by the Gate of St. Paul (close to the
Pyramid of C. Sestius, and now overlooking the
English Cemetery and Keats' grave) offered to surrender
their post to the Gothic king. To distract
the attention of the garrison he sent by night a little
band of soldiers on two skiffs up the Tiber as far as
they could penetrate towards the heart of the City.
These men blew a loud blast with their trumpets,
and thereby called the bulk of the defenders down
to the river-walls, while the Isaurians were opening
St. Paul's Gate to the besiegers, who marched in
almost unopposed. The garrison galloped off along
the road to Civita Vecchia, and on their way fell
<a name="p362" id="p362"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 362</span>
into an ambush which Totila had prepared for them,
whereby most of them perished (549).</p>

<p>Totila, now a second time master of Rome, determined
to hold it securely. He restored some of the
public buildings which he had previously destroyed;
he adorned and beautified the City to the utmost of
his power; he invited the Senators and their families
to return; he celebrated the equestrian games in the
Circus Maximus: in all things he behaved himself
as much as possible like one of the old Emperors of Rome.</p>

<p>The year 550 was the high-water mark of the success
of the Gothic arms. In Italy only four cities--all
on the sea-coast--were left to the Emperor; these
were Ravenna, Ancona, Otranto, and Crotona. In
Sicily most of the cities were still Imperial, but
Totila had moved freely hither and thither through
the island, ravaging the villas and the farms, collecting
great stores of grain and fruit, driving off horses
and cattle, and generally visiting on the hapless
Sicilians the treachery which in his view they had
shown to the Ostrogothic dynasty by the eagerness
with which, fifteen years before, they had welcomed
the arms of Belisarius.</p>

<p>But at the end of a long and exhausting war it is
often seen that victory rests with that power which
has enough reserve force left to make one final effort,
even though that effort in the earlier years of the
war might not have been deemed a great one. So
was it now with Justinian's conquest of Italy.
Though he himself was utterly weary of the Sisyphean
labour, he would not surrender a shred of his
<a name="p363" id="p363"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 363</span>
theoretical claims, nor would he even condescend to
admit to an audience the ambassadors of Totila, who
came to plead for peace and alliance between the
two hostile powers.</p>

<p>In his perplexity as to the further conduct of the
war he offered the command to his Grand Chamberlain
Narses, who eagerly accepted it. The choice
was indeed a strange one. Narses, an Armenian by
birth, brought as an eunuch to Constantinople, and
dedicated to the service of the palace, had grown grey
in that service, and was now seventy-four years of age.
But he was of "Illustrious" rank, he shared the most
secret counsels of the Emperor, he was able freely to
unloose the purse-strings which had been so parsimoniously
closed to Belisarius, and he had set his
whole heart on succeeding where Belisarius had
failed. Moreover, he was himself both wealthy and
generous, and he brought with him a huge and
motley host of barbarians, Huns, Lombards, Gepids,
Herulians, all eager to serve under the free-handed
Chamberlain, and to be enriched by him with the
spoil of Italy.</p>

<p>In the spring of 552, the Eunuch-general, with
this strange multitude calling itself a Roman army,
marched round the head of the Adriatic Gulf and
entered the impregnable seat of Empire, Ravenna.
By adroit strategy he evaded the Gothic generals
who had been ordered to arrest his progress in North-eastern
Italy and--probably by about midsummer--he
had reached the point a little south-west of Ancona,
where the Flaminian Way, the great northern
road from Rome, crosses the Apennines. Here on
<a name="p364" id="p364"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 364</span>
the crest of the mountains<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a>
<a href="#footnote157"><sup class="sml">157</sup></a> Narses encamped, and
here Totila met him, eager for the fight which was to
decide the future dominion of Italy.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote157"
name="footnote157"></a><b>Footnote 157:</b><a href="#footnotetag157">
(return) </a> There is some little difference of opinion as to the site of this
battle. I place it near the Roman posting station of Ad Ensem,
represented by the modern village of Scheggia, in latitude 43º 25'
north.</blockquote>

<p>A space of about twelve miles separated the hostile
camps. Narses sent some of his most trusted
counsellors to warn Totila not to continue the
struggle any longer against the irresistible might of
the Empire; "but if you will fight", said the messengers,
"name the day". Totila indignantly spurned
the proposal of surrender and named the eighth day
from thence as the day of battle. Narses, however,
suspecting some stratagem, bade his troops prepare
for action, and it was well that he did so, for on the
next day Totila with all his army was at hand.</p>

<p>A hill, which to some extent commanded the battle-field,
was the first objective point of both generals.
Narses sent fifty of his bravest men over-night to
take up their position on this hill, and the Gothic
troops, chiefly cavalry, which were sent to dislodge
them, failed to effect their purpose, the horses being
frightened by the din which the Imperial soldiers
made, clashing with their spears upon their shields.
Several lives were lost on this preliminary skirmish,
the honours of which remained with the soldiers of
Narses.</p>

<p>At dawn of day the troops were drawn up in order
of battle, but Narses had made all his arrangements
on a defensive rather than an offensive plan and
<a name="p365" id="p365"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 365</span>
Totila, who was expecting a reinforcement of two
thousand Goths under his brave young lieutenant
Teias, wished to postpone the attack. Both generals
harangued their armies: Totila, in words of lordly
scorn for the patch-work host of various nationalities
which Justinian, weary of the war, had sent against
him. It was the Emperor's last effort, he declared, and
when this heterogeneous army was defeated, the
brave Goths would be able to rest from their labours.
Narses, on the other hand, congratulated his soldiers
on their evident superiority in numbers to the
Gothic host. They fought too, as he reminded
them, for the Roman Empire, which was in its nature,
and by the will of Providence, eternal, while these
little barbarian states, Vandal, Gothic, and the like,
sprang up like mushrooms, lived their little day, and
then vanished away, leaving no trace behind them.
He had recourse also to less refined and philosophical
arguments. Riding rapidly along the ranks,
the Eunuch dangled before the eyes of his barbarian
auxiliaries golden armlets, golden collars, golden
bridles. "These", said he, "and such other ornaments
as these, shall be the reward of your valour, if
you fight well to-day".</p>

<p>The long morning of waiting was partly occupied
by a duel between two chosen champions. A warrior,
named Cocas, who had deserted from Emperor
to King, rode up to the Imperial army, challenging
their bravest to single combat. One of Narses' lifeguards,
an Armenian' like his master, Anzalas by
name, accepted the challenge. Cocas couched his
spear and rode fiercely at his foe, thinking to pierce
<a name="p366" id="p366"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 366</span>
him in the belly. Anzalas dexterously swerved
aside at the critical moment and gave a thrust with his
spear at the left side of his antagonist, who fell lifeless
to the ground. A mighty shout rose from the
Imperial ranks at this propitious omen of the coming
battle. Not yet, however, was that battle to be
gained. King Totila rode forth in the open space
between both armies, "that he might show the enemy
what manner of man he was". His armour was
lavishly adorned with gold: from the cheek-piece of
his helmet, from his <i>pilum</i> and his spear hung purple
pennants; his whole equipment was magnificent
and kingly. Bestriding a very tall war-horse he
played the game of a military athlete with accomplished
skill. He wheeled his horse first to the
right, then to the left, in graceful curves; then he
tossed his spear on high to the morning breezes and
caught it in the middle as it descended with quivering
fall; then he threw it deftly from one hand to
another, he stooped low on his horse, he raised himself
up again. Everything was done as artistically as
the dance of a well-trained performer. All this "was
beautiful to look at, but it was not war". The ugly,
wrinkled old Armenian in the other camp, who
probably kept his seat on horseback with difficulty,
knew, one may suspect, more of the deadly science
of war than the brilliant and martial Totila.</p>

<p>At length the long-looked-for two thousand arrived,
and Totila gave the signal to charge upon the
foe. It was the hour of the noon-tide meal, and he
hoped to catch the Imperial troops in the disorder of
their repast; but for this also Narses, the wary, had
<a name="p367" id="p367"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 367</span>
provided. Even the food necessary to support their
strength was to be taken by the soldiers, all keeping
their ranks, all armed, and all watching intently the
movements of the enemy. Narses had purposely
somewhat weakened his centre in order to strengthen
his wings, which, as the Gothic cavalry charged,
closed round them and poured a deadly shower of
arrows into their flanks. Again, as in the campaigns
of Belisarius, the <i>Hippo-toxotai</i>, the "Mounted Rifles"
of the Empire, decided the fate of the battle. Vain
against their murderous volleys was the valour of
the Gothic horseman, the thrust of the Gothic lance,
the might of the tall Gothic steed. Charge upon
charge of the Goths was made in vain; the cavalry
could never reach the weak but distant centre of the
Imperialists. At length, when the sun was declining,
the horsemen came staggering back, a disorganised
and beaten band. Their panic communicated itself to
the infantry, who were probably the weakest section
of the army; the rout was complete, and the whole of
the Gothic host was seen either flying, surrendering,
or dying.</p>

<p>As evening fell Totila, with five of his friends
hastened from the lost battle-field. A young Gepid
chief, named Asbad, ignorant who he was couched
his lance to strike Totila in the back. A young
Gothic page incautiously cried out, "Dog! would
you strike your lord?" hereby revealing the rank of
the fugitive and, of course, only nerving the arm of
Asbad to strike a more deadly blow. Asbad was
wounded in return and his companions intent on
staunching his wound let the fugitives ride on, but
<a name="p368" id="p368"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 368</span>
the wound of Totila was mortal. His friends hurried
him on, eight miles down the valley, to the little
village of Capræ, where they alighted and strove to
tend his wound. But their labour was vain; the
gallant king soon drew his last breath and was
hastily buried by his comrades in that obscure
hamlet.</p>

<p>The Romans knew not what had become of their
great foe till several days after, when some soldiers
were riding past the village, a Gothic woman told
them of the death of Totila and pointed out to them
his grave. They doubted the truth of her story, but
opened the grave and gazed their fill on that which
was, past all dispute, the corpse of Totila. The news
brought joy to the heart of Narses, who returned
heartiest thanks to God and to the Virgin, his especial
patroness, and then proceeded to disembarrass
himself as quickly as possible of the wild barbarians,
especially the Lombards, by whose aid he had won
the victory which destroyed the last hopes of the
Ostrogothic monarchy in Italy.<a id="footnotetag158" name="footnotetag158"></a>

<p>(568) Not thus easily, however, was the tide of barbarian
invasion to be turned. The Lombards had found
their way into Italy as auxiliaries. They
returned thither sixteen years after as conquerors,
conquerors the most ruthless and brutal
that Italy had yet groaned under. From that day
<a name="p369" id="p369"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 369</span>
for thirteen centuries the unity of Italy was a dream.
First the Lombard King and the Byzantine Emperor
tore her in pieces. Then the Frank descended from
the Alps to join in the fray. The German, the
Saracen, the Norman made their appearance on
the scene. Not all wished to ravage and despoil;
some had high and noble purposes in their hearts,
but, in fact, they all tended to divide her. The
Popes even at their best, even while warring as
Italian patriots against the foreign Emperor, still
divided their country. Last of all came the Spaniard
and the Austrian, by whom, down to our own day,
Italy was looked upon as an estate, out of which
kingdoms and duchies might be carved at pleasure as
appanages for younger sons and compensations for
lost provinces. Only at length, towards the close of
the nineteenth century, has Italy regained that
priceless boon of national unity, which might have
been hers before it was attained by any other
country in Europe, if only the ambition of emperors
and the false sentiment of "Roman" patriots would
have spared the goodly tree which had been planted
in Italian soil by Theodoric the Ostrogoth.</p>

<h3>THE THEODORIC OF SAGA.</h3>

<p>The fame of Theodoric attested by the Saga dealing with his name,
utterly devoid as they are of historic truth--The Wilkma Saga--Story
of Theodoric's ancestors--His own boyhood--His companions,
Master Hildebrand, Heime, and Witig--Death of his father
and his succession to the throne--Herbart wooes King Arthur's
daughter, first for Theodoric and then for himself--Hermanric,
his uncle, attacks Theodoric--Flight and exile at the Court of
Attila--Attempt to return--Attila's sons slain in battle--The
tragedy of the Nibelungs--Theodoric returns to his kingdom--His
mysterious end.</p>
<br>

<p><img class="lef" alt="" src="images/060.png">t is one of the most striking testimonies
to the greatness of Theodoric's
work and character, that his name is one of the very few
which passed from history into the epic poetry of the German and
Scandinavian peoples. True, there is scarcely one feature of the great Ostrogothic King preserved in the
mythical portrait painted by minstrels and Sagamen;
true, Theodoric of Verona would have listened in
<a name="p371" id="p371"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 371</span>
incredulous or contemptuous amazement to the romantic
adventures related of Dietrich of Bern; still the
fact that his name was chosen by the poets of the early
Middle Ages as the string upon which the pearls of
their fantastic imaginations were to be strung, shows
how powerfully his career had impressed their barbaric
forefathers. Theodoric's eminence in this
respect, his renown in mediæval Saga, is shared
apparently but by three other undoubtedly historic
personages: his collateral ancestor, Hermanric; the
great world-conqueror, Attila; and Gundahar, king
of the Burgundians, about whom history really records
nothing, save his defeat in battle by the Huns.</p>

<p>As it would be a hopeless attempt in a short chapter
like the present to discuss the various allusions to
Dietrich von Bern in the Teutonic and Scandinavian
Sagas, I shall invite the reader's attention to one
only, that which concerns itself most exclusively with
his life, and which is generally called the "Wilkina
Saga",<a id="footnotetag160" name="footnotetag160"></a>
<a href="#footnote160"><sup class="sml">160</sup></a> though some German scholars prefer to call it by the more appropriate name of "Thidreks Saga".</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote160"
name="footnote160"></a><b>Footnote 160:</b><a href="#footnotetag160">
(return) </a> So called because it contains a large number of episodes as to King Wilkinus, his descendants, and the land known by his name, Wilkina-land (Norway and Sweden). Some suppose the name to be a corruption of Viking.</blockquote>

<p>The earliest manuscripts of this Saga at present
known are attributed to the first half of the thirteenth
century. There are many allusions in the work to
other sources of information both written and oral,
but the Saga itself in its present form appears to
<a name="p372" id="p372"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 372</span>
contain the story of Theodoric as current in the
neighbourhood of Bremen and Münster, translated
into the old Norse language, and no doubt somewhat
modified by the influence of Scandinavian legends
on the mind of the translator. In its present form it
is not a poem but a prose work, and though the flow
of the ballad and the twang of the minstrel's harp
still often make themselves felt even through the dull
Latin translation of Johan Peringskiold, there are
many chapters of absolutely unredeemed prose, full
of genealogical details and the marches of armies,
as dry as any history, though purely imaginary.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to give the outline of the story
of Theodoric as told in the "Wilkina Saga", I shall
not harass the reader by continual repetitions of the
phrase "It is said", or "It is fabled", but will ask
him to understand once for all that the story so circumstantially
told is a mere romance, having hardly
the slenderest connection with the actual history of
Theodoric, or with any other event that has happened
on our planet.</p>

<p>The Knight Samson, the grandfather of Theodoric,
was a native of Salerno and served in the court
of Earl Roger, the lord of that city Tall and dark,
with black brows and long, thin face, he was distinguished
by great personal strength, and his ambition
was equal to his prowess. Earl Roger had a most
lovely daughter, Hildeswide, to whom Samson
dared to raise his eyes in love. Being sent one day
by her father to the tower where she dwelt, with
dainty morsels from his table for her repast, he persuaded
her to mount his servant's horse and ride
<a name="p373" id="p373"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 373</span>
away with him into the forest. For this Earl Roger
confiscated his possessions and sought his life. Enraged
at the decree of exile and death which had
been passed against him, Samson issued forth from
his forest to ravage Earl Roger's farms. In his
return to the forest, being intercepted by the Earl
and sixty of his knights, he was seized with sudden
fury, and struck down the Earl's standard-bearer,
dealt so terrible a blow at the Earl that he lopped
off not only his head but that of the steed on which
he rode, slew fifteen knights besides, and then
galloped off, himself unwounded, to the forest where
Hildeswide abode. Thus did Salerno lose her lord.</p>

<p>Brunstein, the brother of Earl Roger, sought to
avenge his death, but after two years of desultory
warfare was himself surprised in a night attack by
Samson, compelled to flee, overtaken and slain. So
Samson went on and increased in strength, treading
down all his enemies; but not till he had persuaded
the citizens of Salerno to accept him as their lord
would he assume the title of king. Then did he
send out messengers to announce to all the other
kingdoms of the world his royal dignity. He governed
long and wisely, extending his dominions to
the vast regions of the West (apparently making
himself lord of all Italy), and by his wife Hildeswide
becoming the father of two sons, whose names were
Hermanric and Dietmar.</p>

<p>After twenty years of wise and peaceful rule, as
Samson sat feasting in his palace he began to lament
the decay of energy in himself and his warriors, and
to fear that his name and fame would perish after
his death. He therefore resolved on war with
<a name="p374" id="p374"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 374</span>
Elsung, Earl of Verona, and to that end despatched
six ambassadors with this insulting message: "Send
hither thy daughter to be the concubine of my
youngest son. Send sixty damsels with her, and
sixty noble youths each bringing two horses and a
servant. Send sixty hawks and sixty retrievers,
whose collars shall be of pure gold, and let the leash
with which they are bound be made of hairs out of
thine own white beard. Do this, or in three months
prepare for war".</p>

<p>This insolent demand produced the expected result.
Elsung ordered the leader of the embassy to
be hung. Four of his companions were beheaded.
The sixth, having had his right hand lopped off, was
sent back with no other answer to Salerno. When
he reached that city, Samson appeared to treat the
matter as of no importance and went on with his
hunting and hawking and all the amusements of a
peaceful court. He was, however, quietly making
his preparations for war, and at the end of three
months, at the head of an army of 15,000 men, commanded
by three under-kings and many dukes he
burst into the territories of Earl Elsung who had
only 10,000 men, drawn from Hungary and elsewhere,
with whom to meet his powerful foe. There was
great slaughter on the battle-plain. Then the two
chiefs met in single combat. Elsung inflicted a
wound on Samson, but Samson cut off Elsung's head
and clutching it by the hoary locks exhibited it in
triumph to his men. The utter rout of the Veronese
army followed. Samson went in state to Verona,
received the submission of the citizens and laid hands
on the splendid treasure of Earl Elsung. He then
<a name="p375" id="p375"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 375</span>
celebrated with great pomp the marriage of Odilia,
the daughter of the slain earl, to his second son Dietmar,
whom he made lord of Verona and all the territory
which had been Elsung's. He marched next
toward "Romaborg" (Rome) intending to make his
eldest son, Hermanric, lord of that city, but died on
the journey. Hermanric, however, after many battles
with the Romans achieved the desired conquest, and
became Lord of Romaborg and the country round it,
even to the Hellespont and the isles of Greece.</p>

<p>Dietmar, son of Samson, King of Verona, was brave,
prudent, and greatly loved by the folk over whom he
ruled. His wife Odilia was one of the wisest of women.
Their eldest son was named Theodoric, and he, when
full grown, though not one of the race of giants, surpassed
all ordinary men in stature. His face was oval,
of comely proportions; he had gray eyes, with black
brows above them; his hair was of great beauty,
long and thick and ending in ruddy curls. He never
wore a beard. His shoulders were two ells broad;
his arms were as thick as the trunk of a tree and as
hard as a stone. He had strong, well-proportioned
hands. The middle of his body was of a graceful
tapering shape, but his loins and hips were wondrously
strong; his feet beautiful and well-proportioned;
his thighs of enormous bigness. His strength was
much beyond the ordinary strength of men. The
size of Theodoric's body was equalled by the qualities
of his mind. He was not only brave but jovial,
good-tempered, liberal, magnificent, always ready to
bestow gold and silver and all manner of precious
things on his expectant friends. It was the saying
of some that the young warrior was like his grandfather,
<a name="p376" id="p376"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 376</span>
Samson; but others held that there was never
any one in the world to compare unto Theodoric.
When he had attained the fifteenth year of his age he
was solemnly created a knight by his father, Dietmar.</p>

<p>Now, while Theodoric was still a child there came
to his father's court one who was to have a great
influence on his after life. This was Hildebrand,
commonly called Master Hildebrand, son of one
of the Dukes of Venice. He was a brave knight
and a mighty one, and when he had reached the age
of thirty he told his father that he would fain see
more of the world than he could do by lingering all his
days at Venice. Upon which his father recommended
him to try his fortune at the court of Dietmar, King
of Verona. He came therefore and was received very
graciously by Dietmar, who conferred great favours
upon him and assigned to him the care of the young
Theodoric then about seven years of age. Hildebrand
taught Theodoric all knightly exercises; together
they ever rode to war, and the friendship
which grew up between them was strong as that
which knit the soul of David to the soul of Jonathan.</p>

<p>One day when Theodoric and Hildebrand were
hunting in the forest, a little dwarf ran across their
path, to which Theodoric gave chase. This dwarf
proved to be Alpris, the most thievish little creature
in the world. Theodoric was about to kill it, but
Alpris said: "If you will spare my life I will get
you the finest sword that ever was made, and will
show you where to find more treasure than ever
your father owned. They belong to a little woman
<a name="p377" id="p377"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 377</span>
called Hildur and her husband Grimur. He is so
strong that he can fight twelve men at once, but she
is much stronger than he, and you will need all your
strength if you mean to overcome them". Having
bound himself by tremendous oaths to perform
these promises, the dwarf was dismissed unhurt, and
the two comrades went on with their hunting. At
evening they stood beside the rock where Alpris was
to meet them. The dwarf brought the sword, and
pointed out the entrance to a cave. The two
knights gazed upon the sword with wonder, agreeing
that they had never seen anything like it in the
world. And no marvel, for this was the famous
sword Nagelring, the fame whereof went out afterwards
into the whole world. They tied up their
horses and went together into the cave. Grimur,
seeing strangers, at once challenged them to fight;
but looking round anxiously for Nagelring, he missed
it, whereupon he cursed the knavish Alpris, who had
assuredly stolen it from him. However, he snatched
from the hearth the blazing trunk of a tree and
therewith attacked Theodoric. Meanwhile Hildebrand,
taken at unawares, was caught hold of by
Hildur, who clung so tightly round his neck that he
could not move. After a long struggle they both
fell heavily to the ground, Hildebrand below, Hildur
on top of him. She squeezed his arms so tightly
that the blood came out at his finger-nails; she
pressed her fist so hard on his throat and breast that
he could hardly breathe. He was fain to cry for
help to Theodoric, who answered that he would do
all in his power to save his faithful friend and tutor
<a name="p378" id="p378"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 378</span>
from the clutches of that foul little wench. With
that he swung round Nagelring and smote off the
head of Grimur. Then he hastened to his foster-father's
aid and cut Hildur in two, but so mighty was
the power of her magic that the sundered halves of
her body came together again. Once more Theodoric
clove her in twain; once more the severed parts
united. Hereupon quoth Hildebrand: "Stand between
the sundered limbs with your body bowed
and your head averted, and the monster will be
overcome". So did Theodoric, once more cleaving
her body in twain and then standing between the
pieces. One half died at once, but that to which
the head belonged was heard to say: "If the Fates
had willed that Grimur should fight Theodoric as
toughly as I fought Hildebrand, the victory had been
ours". With these words the brave little woman died.</p>

<p>Hildebrand congratulated his pupil on his glorious
victory, and they then proceeded to despoil the cave
of its treasures. One of the chief of these was a
helmet of wonderful strength, the like of which
Theodoric had never seen before. It was made by
the dwarf Malpriant, and so greatly had the strange
couple prized it that they had given it their united
names Hildegrimur. This helmet guarded Theodoric's
head in many a fierce encounter, and by its
help and that of the sword Nagelring he gained
many a victory. Bright was the renown which he
won from this deed of arms.</p>

<p>So great was the fame of the young hero that
striplings from distant lands, thirsting for glory, came
to Dietmar's court that they might be enrolled
<a name="p379" id="p379"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 379</span>
among the comrades of Theodoric. There were
twelve of these who, when they came to manhood,
were especially distinguished as the chiefs of his
army, and among these Theodoric shone pre-eminent,
even as his contemporary, Arthur, king of Bertangenland,<a id="footnotetag161" name="footnotetag161"></a>
<a href="#footnote161"><sup class="sml">161</sup></a>
 among the Knights of his Table Round.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote161"
name="footnote161"></a><b>Footnote 161:</b><a href="#footnotetag161">
(return) </a> Britain.</blockquote>

<p>But there were two of these comrades, friendly to
Theodoric, though by no means friendly to one another,
who were more renowned than any of the
rest for their knightly deeds and strange adventures.
These were Witig and Heime, each of whom, having
first fought with Theodoric, was afterwards for many
years his loyal and devoted knight.</p>

<p>Heime was the son of a great horse-breeder who
dwelt north of the mountains, and whose name was
Studas. He was short and squat of figure and
square of face, but was all made for strength; and
he was churlish and morose of disposition, wherefore
men called him Heime (which was the name of
a strong and venomous serpent), instead of Studas,
which was of right his name as well as his father's.
One day Heime, having mounted his famous grey
horse Rispa, and girded on his good sword Blutgang,
announced to his father that he would ride
southward over the mountains to Verona, and there
challenge Theodoric to a trial of strength. Studas
tried to dissuade his son, telling him that his presumption
would cost him his life; but Heime answered:
"Thy life and thy calling are base and
inglorious, and I would rather die than plod on in
<a name="p380" id="p380"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 380</span>
this ignoble round. But, moreover, I think not to
fall by the hand of Theodoric. He is scarce twelve
winters old, and I am sixteen; and where is the man
with whom I need fear to fight?" So Heime rode
over the rough mountain ways, and appearing in
the court-yard of the palace at Verona, challenged
Theodoric to fight. Indignant at the challenge, but
confident of victory, Theodoric went forth to the
encounter, having donned his iron shoes, his helmet
and coat of mail, and taking his great thick shield,
red as blood, upon which a golden lion ramped, and
above all, his good sword Nagelring.</p>

<p>The young heroes fought at first on horseback,
and in this encounter, though Theodoric's spear
pierced Heime's shield and inflicted upon him a
slight wound, a stumble of his horse had nearly
brought him to the ground. But then, as both
spears were shivered, the combatants sprang from
their horses, waved high their swords, and continued
the fight on foot. At last Heime dealt Theodoric
a swashing blow on his head, but the good helmet
Hildegrimur was so strong that it shivered the
sword Blutgang to pieces, and there stood Heime
helpless, at the mercy of the boy whom he had
challenged. Theodoric gladly spared his life, and
received him into the number of his henchmen, and
after that they were for many years sworn friends.</p>

<p>It was some time after this that another young
man appeared at Verona and challenged Theodoric
to single combat. This was Witig, the Dane, son
of that mighty worker in iron, Wieland,<a id="footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a>
<a href="#footnote162"><sup class="sml">162</sup></a>
<a name="p381" id="p381"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 381</span>
who had in his veins the blood of kings and of mysterious
creatures of the deep, but who spent all his days in
his smithy, forging strange weapons, and whose
wrongs and terrible revenges and marvellous escapes
from death are sung by all the minstrels of
the North. When he was twelve years old, Witig,
drawn like so many other brave youths by the
renown of the young Theodoric, announced to his
father that he was determined to seek glory in the
land of the Amelungs.<a id="footnotetag163" name="footnotetag163"></a>
<a href="#footnote163"><sup class="sml">163</sup></a> Wieland would fain have
had him stay in the smithy and learn his own
wealth-bringing craft; but Witig swore by the
honour of his mother, a king's daughter, that never
should the smith's hammer and tongs come into his
hand. Thereupon Wieland gave him a coat of mail
of hard steel, which shone like silver, and greaves of
chain-armour; a white shield, on which were painted
in red the smith's hammer and tongs, telling of his
father's trade, and three carbuncles, which he bore
in right of the princess, his mother. On his strong
steel helmet a golden dragon gleamed and seemed
to spit forth venom. Into his son's right hand
Wieland gave the wondrous sword Mimung, which
he had fashioned for a cruel king, and which was so
sharp that it cut through a flock of wool, three feet
thick, when floating on the water. Witig's mother
gave him three golden marks and her gold ring, and
he kissed his father and his mother and wished them
a happy life, and they wished him a prosperous journey
and were sore at heart when he turned to go.</p>

<a name="p382" id="p382"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 382</span>

<p>But he grasped his spear and sprang into the saddle,
all armed as he was, without touching the stirrup.
Then Wieland's face grew bright again, and he
walked long by the side of his son's horse and gave
him full knowledge of the road he must take. So
they parted, father and son, and Witig rode upon
his way.</p>

<p>Long before he reached Verona he had met with
many adventures, especially one in which he overcame
twelve robbers who held a strong castle by a
bridge and were wont to take toll of travellers.
These robbers seeing Witig draw nigh parted among
them in anticipation his armour and his horse, and
planned also to maim him, cutting off his right hand
and right foot, but with the good sword Mimung he
slew two of them and was fighting valiantly with the
rest when certain knights whom he had before met
on the road came to his help, and between them
they slew seven of the robbers and put the others to
flight. These knights were Hildebrand and Heime,
and a stranger whom they were escorting to the
court of Verona. Heime, who was already jealous
of Witig's power and prowess, had sought to dissuade
his companions from going to his help; but
Hildebrand refused to do so unknightly a deed as to
let their road-companion be overpowered by ruffians
before their very eyes without giving him succour.
So now, the victory being won and Witig having
displayed his might, they all made themselves known
unto him. Hildebrand swore "brotherhood in arms"
with Witig, but having heard of his determination to
challenge Theodoric to single combat, secretly by
<a name="p383" id="p383"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 383</span>
night changed the sword Mimung for one less finely
tempered. For he feared for his young lord's life if
that sword, wielded by Witig's strong hand, should
ever descend upon Theodoric's helmet.</p>

<p>At length the wayfarers all entered the gates of
Verona. Great was Theodoric's joy to behold again
the good Master Hildebrand; but great was his indignation
when the young Dane, who came with Hildebrand, challenged him to single combat. Said Theodoric: "In my father's land and
mine I will establish such peace that it shall not
be permitted to every rover and rascal to come into it and challenge
me to the duel".</p>

<p>Hildebrand: "Thou sayest not rightly, my lord,
nor knowest of whom thou speakest. This is no
rover nor rascal, but a brave man; and in sooth
I know not whether thou wilt get the victory over
him".</p>

<p>Then interrupted Reinald, a follower of Theodoric:
"That were in truth, my lord, a great offence that
every upstart urchin in thine own land should come
and challenge thee to the fight".</p>

<p>Hildebrand: "Thou shalt not assail my journey-companion
with any such abusive words".</p>

<p>And thereat he dealt Reinald such a blow with his
fist on his ear that he fell senseless to the ground.
Then said Theodoric: "I see thou art determined
to be this man's friend; but thou shalt see how
much good that does him. This very day he shall
be hung up yonder outside the gates of Verona".</p>

<p>Hildebrand: "If he becomes thy prisoner, after
you have both tried your might, I will not complain
<a name="p384" id="p384"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 384</span>
however hard thy decision may seem to me; but he
is still unbound, and I think thou hast a hard day's
work before thee, ere thou becomest lord of his
fate".</p>

<p>Theodoric in a rage called for his horse and
armour and rode, followed by a long train of courtiers,
to the place of tourney outside the walls of
Verona, where Witig and Hildebrand, with few companions,
were awaiting him. Witig sate, arrayed in
full armour, on his horse, battle-ready and stately to
look upon. Then Heime gave Theodoric a bowl
of wine and said: "Drink, my lord, and may God
give thee the victory". Theodoric drank and gave
back the bowl. Likewise Hildebrand offered a bowl
to Witig, who said: "Take it to Theodoric and pray
him to drink to me from it". But Theodoric in his
rage refused to touch the bowl that Witig was to
drink from. Then said Hildebrand: "Thou knowest
not the man with whom thou art so enraged, but
thou wilt find him a true hero and not the good-for-nothing
fellow thou hast called him to-day". Then
he gave Witig the bowl and said: "Drink now, and
then defend thyself with all manhood and bravery,
and may God give thee his succour". And Witig
drank and gave it back to Hildebrand, and with it
the gold ring of his mother, saying: "God reward
thee for thy true help-bringing".</p>

<p>Of the fierce battle between the two heroes which
now followed it were too long to tell the tale. They
fought first on horseback, then they fought on foot.
Witig dealt a mighty blow with his sword at Theodoric's
helmet, but the helmet Hildegrimur was too
<a name="p385" id="p385"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 385</span>
strong for the sword which Hildebrand had put in
the place of Mimung, and which now was shivered
into two pieces. "Ah, Wieland!" cried Witig in
vexation, "God's wrath be on thee for fashioning
this sword so ill! If I had had a good sword, I had
this day proved myself a hero; but now shame and
loss are mine and his who forged my weapon".</p>

<p>Then Theodoric took the sword Nagelring with
both his hands and was about to cut off Witig's
head. But Hildebrand stepped in between and
begged Theodoric to spare Witig's life and take
him for a comrade, telling of his brave deeds against
the twelve robbers, and declaring that never would
Theodoric have a more valiant or loyal follower than
this man, who was of kingly blood on both his
father's and mother's side, and was now willing to
become Theodoric's man. But Theodoric, still indignant
at being challenged, as he deemed, by a son
of a churl, said sullenly: "No; the dog shall hang,
as I said he should, before the gates of Verona".
Then Hildebrand, seeing that nought else would
avail, and that Theodoric heeded not good counsel,
drew Mimung from the scabbard and gave it to
Witig, saying: "For the sake of the brotherhood in
arms which we swore when we met upon the journey,
I give thee here thy sword Mimung. Take it and
defend thyself like a knight". Then was Witig
joyous as a bird at daybreak. He kissed the golden-hilted
sword and said: "May God forgive me for
the reproach which I hurled at my father, Wieland.
See! Theodoric, noble hero! see! here is Mimung.
Now am I joyous for the fight with thee as a thirsty
<a name="p386" id="p386"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 386</span>
man for drinking, or a hungry hound for feeding".
Then he rained on Theodoric blow on blow, hacking
away now a piece of his coat of mail, now a splinter
from his helmet. Theodoric, bleeding from five
great wounds, and thinking only now of defence,
never of attack, called on Master Hildebrand to end
the combat; but Hildebrand, still sore at heart because
Theodoric seemed to accuse him of lying when
he called Witig a hero, told him that he might now
expect to receive from the conqueror the same disgraceful
doom which he in his arrogance and cruelty
had adjudged to the conquered.</p>

<p>Then King Dietmar came and besought Witig to
spare his son's life, offering him a castle and an earl's
rank and a noble wife; but Witig spurned his gifts,
and told him that it would be an unkingly deed if
he, by his multitude of men-at-arms, stayed the
single combat which was turning against his son.
So, after these words, they renewed the fight; and
now, by a mighty blow from the good sword Mimung,
even the stout helmet was cloven asunder from right
to left, and the golden hair of Theodoric streamed
out of the fissure. With that Hildebrand relented,
and springing between the twain, begged Witig, for
the sake of the brotherhood that was sworn between
them, to give peace to Theodoric and take him for
his comrade--And when you two shall stand side
by side there will be none in the world that can
stand against you". "Though he deserves it not",
said Witig, "yet since thou askest it, and for our
brotherhood's sake, I grant him his life".</p>

<p>Then they laid their weapons aside and clasped
<a name="p387" id="p387"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 387</span>
one another's hands, and became good friends and
comrades. So they rode back to Verona, and were
all merry together.</p>

<p>Many days lay Theodoric at Verona, for his
wounds in the fight were grevious. At length he
rode forth on his good steed Falke, in quest of adventures,
to brighten again his honour which was
tarnished by the victory of Witig. After many days
he reached a certain forest which was near the castle
of Drachenfels. Through that forest, as he was told,
there was wont to wander a knight named Ecke, who
was betrothed to the chatelaine of Drachenfels, a
widowed queen with nine fair daughters. Having
heard of the might of the unconquered Ecke,
Theodoric, who was still somewhat weakened by his
wounds, thought to pass through the forest by night
and so avoid an encounter. But as luck would have
it, the two knights met in the thick wood where
neither could see the other, and Ecke, having called
upon the unseen traveller to reveal his name, and
finding that it was Theodoric, tempted him to single
combat by every taunt and lure that he could think
of, by sneering at him for Witig's victory and by
praising his own good sword Ecke-sax, made in the
same smithy as Nagelring, gold-hilted and gold-inlaid,
so that when you held it downwards a serpent of
gold seemed to run along the blade from the handle
to the point. Neither this temptation nor yet that
of the twelve pounds of ruddy gold in Ecke's girdle
prevailed on Theodoric, who said again and again:
"I will fight thee gladly when day dawns, but not
here in the darkness, where neither of us can see his
<a name="p388" id="p388"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 388</span>
foe". But when Ecke began to boast of the stately
queen, his betrothed, and of the nine princesses
who had armed him for the fight, said Theodoric:
"In heaven's name I will fight thee, not for gold nor
for thy wondrous sword, but for glory and for the
prize of those nine fair daughters of a king". Then
they struck their swords against the stones in the
road, and by the light of the sparks they closed on
one another. Shield was locked in shield, the weapons
clashed, the roar of their battle was like the roar
of a thunderstorm, but or ever either had wounded
his foe, they fell to the ground, Ecke above, Theodoric
below, "Now, if thou wouldst save thy life",
said Ecke, "thou shalt let me bind thee, and take
thy armour and thy steed, and thou shalt come with
me to the castle, and there will I show thee bound to
the princesses who equipped me for this encounter".
"Rather will I die", said Theodoric "than be made
mock of by these nine princesses and their mother,
and by all who shall hereafter see or hear of me".
Then he struggled, and got his hands free, and
clutched Ecke round the neck, and so they wrestled to
and fro upon the turf in the dark forest. But meanwhile
the good steed Falke, hearing his master in
distress, bit in two the bridle by which Theodoric had
fastened him to a tree, and ran to where the two
knights lay struggling on the earth. Stamping with
his forefeet, with all his might, upon Ecke, Falke
broke his spine. Then sprang Theodoric to his feet,
and drawing his sword he cut off the head of his foe.
Equipping himself in Ecke's arms he rode forth from
the forest at daybreak, and drew near to the castle of
<a name="p389" id="p389"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 389</span>
Drachenfels. The queen, standing on the top of
her tower, and seeing a man clad in Ecke's armour
approach, riding a noble war-horse, called to her
daughters: "Come hither and rejoice. Ecke went
forth on foot, but he rides back on a noble steed.
Doubtless he has slain some knight in single combat".
Then the queen and all her daughters, dressed
in their goodliest raiment, went forth to meet the
conqueror. But when they came nearer and saw that
the arms of Ecke were borne by an unknown stranger,
they read the battle more truly. Then the
queen sank to the ground in a swoon, and the nine
fair princesses went back to the castle and put on
robes of mourning, and told the men-at-arms to ride
forth and avenge their champion. So Theodoric
perceived that the princesses were not for him, and
rode away from the castle.</p>

<p>Now, Ecke had one brother named Fasold, and
this man had bound himself by a vow never to smite
more than one blow at any who came against him
in battle. But so doughty a champion was he that
this one blow had till now been sufficient for every
antagonist. When Fasold saw Theodoric come
riding through the wood towards him he cried out:
"Art thou not my brother Ecke?"</p>

<p>Theodoric: "Another am I, and not thy brother".</p>

<p>Fasold: "Base death-dog! thou hast stolen on my
brother Ecke in his sleep and murdered him; for
when he was awake thou hadst never overcome that
strifeful hero".</p>

<p>Theodoric: "Thou liest there. He forced me, to
fight for honour's sake and for the sake of his
<a name="p390" id="p390"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 390</span>
betrothed and the nine fair princesses, her daughters.
But a brave man truly he was, and had I known how
great a warrior I would never have ventured to match
myself against him".</p>

<p>Then Fasold rushed at Theodoric with drawn
sword, and dealt a terrible blow upon his helmet,
which stunned Theodoric and stretched him senseless
on the ground. Remembering his vow, Fasold then
turned away and rode towards the castle.</p>

<p>Before long, however, Theodoric's soul returned
into him, and springing on his horse he rode furiously
after Fasold, and with taunting words provoked
him to the fight, declaring that he was a
"Nithing"<a id="footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a>
<a href="#footnote164"><sup class="sml">164</sup></a>
if he would not avenge his brother.
With that Fasold turned back, and the two heroes
leaping from their horses began the fight on foot.
It was a long and terrible combat, but it began to
turn against Fasold. He had received five grievous
wounds, while Theodoric had but three, and of a
slighter kind. Perceiving, therefore, that the longer
the fight lasted the more certain he was to be at last
slain, and as to each man his own life is most precious,
this great and valiant hero begged his life of Theodoric,
and offered to become his henchman. "Peace
I will have with thee", said Theodoric, "but not thy
service, seeing that thou art so noble a knight, and
that I have slain thy brother. On this one condition
will I grant thee thy life, that thou wilt clasp
my hand and swear brotherhood in arms with me,
that each of us shall help the other in all time of his
need as if we were born brothers, and that all men
<a name="p391" id="p391"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 391</span>
shall know us for loyal comrades". Fasold gladly
took the oath, and they mounted their horses and
rode together towards Verona.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote164"
name="footnote164"></a><b>Footnote 164:</b><a href="#footnotetag164">
(return) </a> Coward, good-for-nothing man.</blockquote>

<p>On their road they met a mighty beast which is
called an elephant. Theodoric, in spite of Fasold's
dissuading words, persisted in attacking it, but
failed, even with the good sword Ecke-sax, to reach
any vital part. Then was he in great danger; nor
would the help which Fasold loyally rendered have
availed him much, for the huge beast was trampling
him under its great forefeet; but the faithful steed
Falke again broke its bridle and came to the help
of its master. The fierce kicks which it gave the
elephant in its side called off its attention from
Theodoric, who once more getting hold of Ecke-sax,
stabbed the elephant in the belly, and sprang
nimbly from under it before it fell down dead.</p>

<p>Riding some way from thence and emerging from
a wood, the two comrades saw a vast dragon flying
through the air at no great distance from the
ground. It had long and sharp claws, a huge and
terrible head, and from its mouth protruded the
head and hands of an armed and still living knight
whom it had half swallowed and was attempting to
carry off. The unhappy victim called on them for
help, and they struck the dragon with their swords,
but its hide was hard, and Fasold's sword was blunt,
and only Theodoric's sword availed aught against it,
"Mine is sharper", cried the captive, but it is inside
the creature's mouth. Use it, if you can, for my
deliverance". Then the valiant Fasold rushed up
and plucked the knight's sword from out of the jaws
<a name="p392" id="p392"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 392</span>
of the dragon. "Strike carefully", said the captive,
"that I be not wounded by mine own sword, for my
legs are inside the creature's mouth". Even so did
they. Both Fasold and Theodoric struck deft blows
and soon killed the dragon, by whose dead body the
three heroes stood on the green turf. They asked
the liberated knight of his name and lineage, and he
turned out to be Sintram, grandson of Bertram,
Duke of Venice, and cousin of good Master Hildebrand,
and then on his way to Verona to visit his
kinsman and to take service under Theodoric.</p>

<p>Eleven days and eleven nights had he been riding,
and at length being weary had laid him down to rest,
when that foul monster stole upon him in his sleep,
and first robbing him of his shield, had then opened
its mouth to swallow him up and bear him away.</p>

<p>Then Theodoric made himself known to Sintram,
who pleaded earnestly that his faithful sword might
be restored to him. Great was the joy when the
heroes were made known one to another. And so
Sintram became one of Theodoric's henchmen, and
served him long and faithfully.</p>

<p>Thus passed the youth of Theodoric--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"When every morning brought a noble chance.</p>
<p>And every chance brought out a noble knight".</p>
</div></div>

<p>Ere many years were gone King Dietmar died,
having scarcely reached middle age, and Theodoric
succeeded him in the kingdom. And he was the
most renowned amongst princes; his fame spread
wide and far over the whole world, and his name
will abide and never be forgotten in all the lands of
the South so long as the world shall endure.
<a name="p393" id="p393"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 393</span>
After he had reigned some years, he willed to
marry, and having heard of the fame of the beautiful
Princess Hilda, daughter of Arthur, King of Britain,
he sent his sister's son, Herbart, to ask for the
maiden's hand. King Arthur liked not that Theodoric
should not have come himself to urge his suit,
and he would not suffer Herbart to have speech of
the princess; but Herbart, who was a goodly youth
and a brave knight, pleased Arthur well, and he kept
him at his court and made him his seneschal. Now
the Lady Hilda was so closely guarded that no
stranger might see her face. She never walked
abroad, except when she went to the church, and
then twelve counts walked on either side holding up
her girdle, and twelve monks followed after, bearing
her train, and twelve great Earls, in coats of mail,
with helmet and sword and shield, brought up the
rear, and looked terrible things on any man who
should be bold enough to try to speak with her.
And over her head was a canopy, in which the
plumes of two great peacocks shielded her beautiful
face from the rays of the sun. Thus went the Lady
Hilda to the place of prayer.</p>

<p>Now Herbart had waited many days, and had
never caught sight of the princess; but at length
there was a great church festival, and she went, thus
magnificently attended, to perform her devotions.
But neither on the road nor yet in the church could
Herbart see her face. But he had prepared two
mice, one adorned with gold and one with silver,
and he took out first one and then the other, and
they ran to where the princess was sitting. Each
<a name="p394" id="p394"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 394</span>
time she looked up to see the mouse running, and
each time he saw her beautiful face, and she saw
that he beheld her, and signals passed between them.
Then she sent her maid to ask him of his name
and parentage, and he said: "I am Herbart, nephew
of Theodoric of Verona, and I crave an interview,
that I may tell mine errand to thy mistress". When
they met outside the church porch, he had only
time to ask the princess to arrange that he might
have longer speech of her, when a monk, one of
her twelve watchers, came by and asked him how
he, a foreigner, could be so bold as to speak with the
princess. But Herbart took the monk by the beard
and shook him so violently that all his teeth rattled,
and told him that he would teach him once for all
how to behave to strangers.</p>

<p>That evening the princess asked her father at the
banquet to let her have whatever she should desire,
and he, for his heart was merry with wine, consented
to her prayer. Then she asked that Herbart, his
handsome seneschal, might be her servant, and King
Arthur, though loath to part with him, for his honour's
sake granted her request. Thereupon Herbart sent
back half of the knights who had accompanied him
from Verona to tell Theodoric that he had seen
Hilda and spoken with her, and that she was the
fairest of women. Glad at heart was Theodork when
he heard these tidings.</p>

<p>And now Herbart had speech often with his mistress,
and began to tell her of his errand and to urge
his uncle's suit. But she said, "What manner of
man is Theodoric of Verona?" "Greatest of all
<a name="p395" id="p395"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 395</span>
heroes", said Herbart, "and kindest and most generous
of men; and if thou wilt be his wedded wife
thou shalt have no lack of gold or silver or jewels".
She said, "Canst thou draw his face upon this wall?"
"Yea", answered he, "and so that every one seeing
it would say, 'That is the face of King Theodoric.'"
Then he drew a great, grim face on the wall, and
said: "Lady, that is he; only, God help me! he is
far more terrible-looking than that". Thereupon she
thought, "God cannot be so wroth with me as to
destine me for that monster". And she looked up
and said, "Sir! why dost thou ask for my hand for
Theodoric, of Verona, and not for thyself?" He
answered: "I was bound to fulfil the message of
my lord; but if thou wilt have me, who am of the
seed of kings, though I am not a king myself, gladly
will I be thy husband, and neither King Arthur nor
King Theodoric nor all their men shall part us twain".</p>

<p>So the two plighted troth to one another, Herbart
and Hilda: and watching their opportunity they
stole away on horseback from the castle. King
Arthur sent after them thirty knights and thirty
squires, with orders to slay Herbart and to bring
Hilda back again; but Herbart defended himself
like a hero, killing twelve knights and fourteen
squires: and the rest fled back to the castle. Herbart,
though sore wounded, mounted his steed and
escaped with his wife to the dominions of a certain
king, who received him graciously, and made him
duke, and gave him broad lands. And he became a
great warrior and did mighty deeds.</p>

<p>After this Theodoric married the eldest of the nine
<a name="p396" id="p396"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 396</span>
fair princesses of Drachenfels, for the love of whom
he had fought with the strong man Ecke. The
name of Theodoric's wife was Gudelinda. Two of
her sisters were married to two of Theodoric's men,
namely, to Fasold, and the merry rogue and stout
warrior, Dietleib,<a id="footnotetag165" name="footnotetag165"></a>
<a href="#footnote165"><sup class="sml">165</sup></a> whose laughter-moving adventures
I have here no room to chronicle. And the
mother, Bolfriana, who was fairest of all the race,
was wooed and won by Witig. But this marriage,
which Theodoric furthered with all his power, brought
ill with it in the end and the separation of tried
friends. For, in order to marry Bolfriana and receive
the lordship of her domains, Witig was obliged to
enter Hermanric's service and become his man. And
though Hermanric promoted him to great honour
and made him a count, this was but a poor amends
for the necessity which, as you shall soon hear, lay
upon Witig, to lift up his sword against his former
master.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote165"
name="footnote165"></a><b>Footnote 165:</b><a href="#footnotetag165">
(return) </a>
Some of these adventures remind us of the story of the kitchen-knave as told in Tennyson's Gareth and Lynette.</blockquote>

<p>Now, Hermanric, as has been said, was sovereign
lord of Rome and of many other fair lands beside:
and all kings and dukes to the south of the great
mountains served him, and, as it seems, even Theodoric
himself owned him as over-lord, and he was by
far the greatest potentate in the south of Europe.
For the Emperor himself then ruled only over Bulgaria
and Greece, while King Hermanric's dominions
included all that lay west of the Sea of Adria.</p>

<p>Till this time Theodoric and his uncle, Hermanric,
had been good friends. The young hero had visited
<a name="p397" id="p397"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 397</span>
the older one at Romaborg, and they had fought
side by side against their enemies. But now came a
disastrous change, which made Theodoric a wanderer
from his home for many years; and this was all the
work of that false traitor, Hermanric's chief counsellor,
Sibich.<a id="footnotetag166" name="footnotetag166"></a>
<a href="#footnote166"><sup class="sml">166</sup></a> For Sibich's honour as a husband had
been stained by his lord while he himself was absent
on an embassy; but instead of avenging himself
with his own right hand on the adulterous king, he
planned a cruel and wide-reaching scheme of vengeance
which should embrace all the kindred of the
wrong-doer. Of Hermanric's three sons he caused
that the eldest should be sent on an embassy to Wilkina-land<a id="footnotetag167" name="footnotetag167"></a>
<a href="#footnote167"><sup class="sml">167</sup></a>
demanding tribute from the king of that
country, and should be slain there by an accomplice;
that the second should be sent on a like embassy to
England, and sailing in a leaky ship, should be swallowed
up by the waves; and that the youngest should
be slain by his father in a fit of rage provoked by the
slanderous accusations of Sibich. Then he set Hermanric
against his nephews, the Harlungs, sons of
his half-brother, Aké; and these hapless young men
were besieged in their Rhine-land castle, to which
Hermanric set fire, and issuing forth, sword in hand,
that they might not die like rats in a hole, were captured
and hung by their enraged uncle on the highest
tree in their own domains. So was all the family of
Hermanric destroyed except Theodoric and his young
brother Diether: and against Theodoric Sibich now
began to ply his engines of calumny. He represented
<a name="p398" id="p398"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 398</span>
 to Hermanric that Theodoric's kingdom had
for some time been growing large, while his own had
been growing smaller, and hinted that soon Theodoric
would openly attack his uncle. Meanwhile,
and in order to test his peaceable disposition, Hermanric,
by Sibich's advice, claimed that he should
pay him tribute for Amalungen-land.<a id="footnotetag168" name="footnotetag168"></a>
<a href="#footnote168"><sup class="sml">168</sup></a> When Theodoric
refused to do this Hermanric was persuaded
of the truth of Sibich's words, and declared that
Theodoric also should be hanged, "for right well do
both he and I know which of us is the mightier".</p>

<p>Witig and Heime, who were now at Hermanric's
court, when they heard these wrathful words, tried in
vain to abate the fury of the king and to open his
eyes to Sibich's falseness; but as they availed nothing,
they mounted their horses and rode with all
speed to Verona. At midnight they reached the
city and told Theodoric the evil tidings, that on the
next day Hermanric would burst upon him with
overwhelming force determined to slay him. Then
Theodoric went into his great hall of audience and
bade the horns blow to summon all his counsellors
and men of war to a meeting there in the dead of
night. He told them all the tidings that Witig had
brought and asked their counsel, whether it were
better to stay in Verona and die fighting--for of successful
resistance to such a force there was no hope--or
to bow for a while to the storm and fleeing from
the home-land seek shelter at some foreign court.
Master Hildebrand advised, and all were of his opinion,
that it was better to flee, and that with all speed,
<a name="p399" id="p399"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 399</span>
before morning dawned. Scarcely had Hildebrand's
words been spoken, when there arose a great sound
of lamentation in Verona, women and children bewailing
that their husbands and fathers were about
to leave them, brothers parting from brothers and
friends from friends. And with all this, in the streets
the neighing of horses, and the clank of arms, as the
warriors, hastily aroused, prepared themselves for
their midnight march.</p>

<p>So Theodoric, with the knights his companions,
rode away from Verona, which Hermanric entered
next morning with five thousand men. And Theodoric
rode first to Bacharach<a id="footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a>
<a href="#footnote169"><sup class="sml">169</sup></a> on the Rhine, where
dwelt the great Margrave, Rudiger, who was his
trusty friend. And from thence he rode on to
Susat,<a id="footnotetag170" name="footnotetag170"></a>
<a href="#footnote170"><sup class="sml">170</sup></a> where was the palace of Attila, King of the
Huns. And when Attila heard that Theodoric was
coming, he bade his men blow the great horns, and
with all his chieftains he poured forth to welcome
him and do him honour. So Theodoric tarried in
the palace of Attila, a cherished and trusted guest,
and there he abode many years.</p>

Susat is identified with Soest in Westphalia, an allocation which is doubtless due to the region in which "Wilkina Saga" was committed to writing (the neighbourhood of Münster and Bremen). The geographical conditions of the story would be better suited by Buda on the Danube, which would, of course, be nearer to historical fact.</blockquote>

<p>Now King Attila had long wars to wage with his
neighbours on the north and east of Hun-land.
These were three brothers, mighty princes, Osantrix,
king of Wilkina-land (Norway and Sweden)
whose daughter Attila had married, and Waldemai,
<a name="p400" id="p400"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 400</span>
king of Russia and Poland, and Ilias, Earl of Greece,
With all Attila waged war, but longest and hardest
with Waldemar. And in all these encounters Theodoric
and his Amalung knights were ever foremost
in the fray and last to retreat, whilst Attila and
his Huns fled often early from the battle-field, leaving
the Amalungs surrounded by their foes. Thus,
once upon a time, Theodoric and Master Hildebrand,
with five hundred men, were surrounded in a fortress
in the heart of Russia: and they suffered dire famine
ere King Attila, earnestly entreated, came to their
rescue. And Master Hildebrand said to the good
knight, Rudiger, who had been foremost in pressing
on to deliver them, "I am now an hundred years old
and never have I been in such sore need as this day.
We had five hundred men and five hundred horses,
and seven only of the horses are left which we have
not killed and eaten".</p>

<p>In this campaign Theodoric took prisoner his
namesake, Theodoric, the son of Waldemar, and
handed him over into the keeping of his good host
and ally, King Attila. By him the captive was at
first thrown into a dreary dungeon, and no care was
taken of his many wounds. But Erka, the queen of
the Huns, who was a cousin of Theodoric, son of
Waldemar, besought her husband that she might be
allowed to take him out of prison and bring him to
the palace and heal his wounds. "If he is healed, he
will certainly escape", said Attila. "If I may only
heal him", said Erka, "I will put my life on the
hazard that he shall not escape". "Be it so", said
Attila, who was going on another campaign into fat
<a name="p401" id="p401"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 401</span>
Russia: "If when I return I find that the son of
Waldemar has escaped, doubt not that I will strike
off thy head".</p>

<p>Then Attila rode forth to war, and Erica commanded
that Theodoric, the son of Waldemar,
should be brought into the palace, and every day
she had dainty dishes set before him, and provided
him with warm baths, and delighted his soul with
gifts of jewels. But Theodoric of Verona, who was
also sore wounded, was left under the care of an
ignorant and idle nurse, and his wounds were not
tended, and were like to become gangrened. So
before many days were passed, the son of Waldemar
was again whole, and clothed him with his coat
and greaves of mail and put his shining helmet on
his head, and mounted his horse and rode from the
palace. Queen Erka implored him to stay, saying
that her head was the pledge of his abiding; but he
answered that he had been all too long already in
Hun-land, and would ride forth to his own country.
Then the queen, in her terror and despair, sought
Theodoric of Verona, where he lay in his ungarnished
chamber with his gangrened wounds; and he,
though he could not forbear to reproach her for her
little kindness to him, and though his wounds made
riding grievous and fighting well-nigh impossible, yet
yielded to her prayers and tears, and rode forth after
the son of Waldemar. Striking spurs into the good
steed Falke, he rode fast and far, and came up at
length with the fugitive. "Return", he cried, "for
the life's sake of thy cousin, Erka; and she and
I together will reconcile thee to Attila, and I will
<a name="p402" id="p402"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 402</span>
give thee silver and gold". But Waldemar's son
utterly refused to return and to be reconciled with
either of his enemies, and scoffed at the foul wounds
of his namesake. "If thou wilt not return for silver
and gold, nor to save the life of thy cousin, Erka,
thou shalt stay for thine own honour's sake, for I
challenge thee here to combat; and never shalt thou
be called aught but a 'Nithing' if thou ridest away
when challenged by one wounded man". At these
words the son of Waldemar had no choice but to
stay and fight. The battle was long and desperate,
and once both champions, sore weary, leaned upon
their shields and rested a space, while he of Verona
in vain renewed to the son of Waldemar his offers of
peace and friendship; but the combat began again
with fury, and at last, with one mighty sword-stroke,
Theodoric of Verona struck the right side of the
neck of the other Theodoric so that his head rolled
off on the left side, and the victor rode back to
Susat with that trophy at his saddle-bow. Queen
Erka, when her cousin's head was thrown by Theodoric
at her feet, wept and bitterly lamented that
so many of her kindred should lose their lives for
her sake.</p>

<p>At length, after many days, Theodoric was healed
of his wounds, and went with Attila on one more
expedition into Russia, in the course of which they
took the cities of Smolensko and Pultowa, and
Theodoric slew King Waldemar on the battle-field.</p>

<p>And now had Theodoric been twenty winters in
Hun-land. He had fought in many great battles,
and had gained broad lands for his host-friend,
<a name="p403" id="p403"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 403</span>
Attila. His young brother, Diether, who had been
brought as a babe from Verona, had grown into
a goodly stripling; and the two sons of Attila, Erp
and Ortwin, who had grown up with him, loved
him as a brother; and Erka, their mother, loved
Diether as her own son. Great, too, was the reverence
shown to Theodoric, who sat at the high-seat
by the side of Attila, and was honoured as his chief
counsellor and friend.</p>

<p>But Theodoric's heart pined for his home and his
lost kingdom, and one day he sought the presence of
Queen Erka and poured out the longings of his soul.
"Good friend, Theodoric", said she, "I will be the
first to aid thee in thine endeavour. I will send with
thee my two sons, Erp and Ortwin, and a thousand
well-armed knights. And now will I seek Attila, my
lord, and adjure him to help thee". Attila at first
took it ill that Theodoric came not himself to urge
his suit, but when Erka had persuaded him that it
was not from pride but from modesty that he made
the request through her, and when she said that she
was willing to send her own sons into danger for his
sake, Attila gladly yielded, and bade his trusty
friend Rudiger, with a body of chosen knights,
accompany Theodoric and his exiled followers back
to their own land.</p>

<p>Then Queen Erka called her two sons to her and
showed them the coats of mail and the greaves of
mail, bright as silver and of hardest steel, but embellished
with ruddy gold, and the helmets and the
thick red shields that she had prepared for their first
day of battle. "Now be brave", said she, weeping,
<a name="p404" id="p404"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 404</span>
"oh, fair sons of mine, even as your arms are strong:
for great as is my longing that you return in safety
to my embraces, I long yet more that all men should
say that you bore yourselves as brave men and
heroes in the fight". And then she armed Diether
in like manner, and said: "Dear foster-son, behold
here my sons Erp and Ortwin, whom I have armed
for war to help thee and Theodoric in the recovery
of your kingdom. You three youths, who are now
here, have loved one another so dearly that never
were you in any game in which you could not be on
the same side and give one another help. Now you
ride forth to war for the first time: keep well together
and help one another in this great game on
which you are now entering". "May God help me,
dear lady", said Diether, "that I may bring back
both thy sons safe and sound; but if they fall in the
storm of war, I will not live to tell the tale".</p>

<p>Of the clang of iron and steel in all the armourers'
shops at Susat, of the stillness which fell upon the
shouting host when Attila, from a high tower, gave
his orders to the army, of the setting forth of the
gallant band, ten thousand knights with many followers,
it needs not to be told at length. Enough,
they crossed the mountains and entered the land
that had been theirs; and Theodoric, to take no unknightly
advantage of his foe, sent messengers to
Rome to apprise Hermanric of his coming and challenge
him to battle outside the walls of Ravenna. <a id="footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a>

<a name="p405" id="p405"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 405</span>

<p>Hermanric, too old to go forth himself to war,
gave the chief command to the false counsellor,
Sibich. Under him were Reinald and Witig, both
of whom had been friends and comrades of Theodoric
in times past, and were most unwilling to fight
against him, though thirsting for battle with any
number of Huns. It was appointed, therefore, that
Sibich, bearing Hermanric's banner, should fight
against Theodoric and his Amalungs, Reinald against
the gallant Rudiger, and Witig against the two sons
of Attila. The whole army of Hermanric numbered
seventeen thousand men. And now were the two
armies drawn up on the opposite banks of a river,
and it was the night before the battle. Master Hildebrand,
desiring to learn the position of the enemy,
rode some way up the stream till he found a ford by
which he crossed to the other side. It was so dark
that he had almost ridden up against another knight
coming in the opposite direction, before either perceived
the other. Dark as it was they soon recognised
one another by their voices, though they had
not met for twenty years. The stranger was Reinald,
who had come forth on the same errand as Hildebrand.
No blows were fought; only friendly words
were exchanged, with lamentations over this miserable
war between the brother Amalungs, and curses
on the false Sibich, whose intrigues had brought it
to pass. Then the moon shone forth, and Reinald
<a name="p406" id="p406"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 406</span>
showed Hildebrand from afar the great yellow tent
with three golden tufts where the traitor Sibich was
sleeping; and the green tent with the silver tuft in
which Witig and his Amalungs were dreaming of
battle with the Huns; and the black tent, then
empty of its lord, that was the tent of Reinald himself.
And Hildebrand told Reinald the ordering of
the troops of Theodoric, showing him Theodoric's
tent with five poles and a golden tuft, and the tent
of the sons of Attila, made of red silk with nine
poles and nine tufts of gold; and the green tent of
Margrave Rudiger. Then the two warriors kissed
each other and wished one another well through the
day of battle, and so they parted. And when Reinald,
returning to the camp, told whom he had met,
Sibich wished to send him to slay Master Hildebrand
before he returned to his friends. But Reinald would
in no wise permit so unknightly a deed, saying that
Sibich must first slay him and all his friends ere such
a thing should befall.</p>

<p>When day dawned Theodoric set forward his
array and bade all his trumpets blow. They rode
up the stream to the ford which Hildebrand had
discovered the night before, and crossed thereby.
And Sibich and Witig, seeing them approach,
sounded their trumpets and marshalled their men.
Theodoric, seeing the false Sibich's banner waving,
cried to his followers: "Forward, my men! Strike
this day with all your courage and knighthood. Ye
have striven often against the Russians and the
Wilkina-men, and have mostly gotten the victory;
but now in this strife we fight for our own land and
<a name="p407" id="p407"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 407</span>
realm, and for the deathless glory that will be ours
if we win our land back again". Then he spurred
his brave old steed Falke through the thickest ranks
of the enemy, raising ever and anon his good sword
Ecke-sax and letting it fall, with every blow felling
a warrior or his horse to the ground. Likewise his
brave standard-bearer Wildeber, who went before
him, hewed down the ranks of the foe. Against
him came Walter, Sibich's standard-bearer, who rode
in hero-mood towards him, and aiming the banner-staff
full against his breast, pierced him through,
the staff coming out through his shoulders. But
Wildeber, though wounded to the death, lopped off
with his sword the end of the banner-staff, and then
riding fiercely at Walter struck him on his thigh so
terrible a blow that the sword cut right through the
coat of mail and stuck fast in the saddle below.
Then did both the standard-bearers fall from their
horses and lie dead on the field side by side.</p>

<p>When Sibich saw his standard droop and the
brave knight Walter fall, he turned his horse and
fled from the field, and all his division of the army
with him. Theodoric and his men rode after them
fast and far, and wrought dire havoc among them,
but when Theodoric was miles away from the battle-plain
he was overtaken by one of his men, his horse
all covered with foam, who brought him evil tidings
from another part of the field.</p>

<p>For Witig, when he saw the flight of Sibich, not
terrified but all the more enraged, had ridden fiercely
towards the place where the banner of Attila's sons
was waving and had struck down their standard-bearer.
<a name="p408" id="p408"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 408</span>
"Seest thou", said Ortwin to Helfric, his
sworn henchman, "what evil that base dog, Witig,
is doing? He has slain our brave standard-bearer;
let us ride up to him and stop his deadly work". So
spake Ortwin, but in the fierce fray that followed
both he and his good comrade Helfric, and then his
brother Erp, fell dead around Witig and his standard-bearer.
Oh! then, great was the wrath of the
young Diether--who meanwhile had fought and
killed the standard-bearer of Witig--when he saw
both of his foster-brothers slain. Eager to avenge
them, he struck oft and hard at Witig's armour.
"Art thou Diether, King Theodoric's brother?"
cried Witig; "for his sake I am loth to do thee any
hurt. Ride away and fight with some other man".
"Since my young lords Erp and Ortwin are dead,
and thou, base hound, hast slain them, I care not for
my life unless I can have thine". So said Diether,
and struck with all his might on Witig's helmet.
The helmet, of hardest steel, resisted the blow, but
the sword, glancing off, descended on the neck of
Witig's war-horse, Schimming, and severed its head
from its body. "God knows", cried Witig, as he
sprang to earth, "that I fight now but to save mine
own life". And with that he grasped the handle of
his sword Mimung with both hands and struck
Diether so terrible a blow that he clove his body in
twain.</p>

<p>These were the tidings which the breathless knight
brought to Theodoric and which stayed him in his
pursuit of the fugitives. "Ah! how have I sinned",
said he "that so evil a day should come upon me?
<a name="p409" id="p409"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 409</span>
Here am I untouched by a wound, but my dearest
brother is dead and my two young lords also. Never
may I now return to Hun-land, but here will I die or
avenge them". And with that he turned and set
spurs to Falke and rode so swiftly that none of his
men could keep up with him; and so full was he of
rage and fury that a hot breath, like sparks of fire,
came forth from his mouth, and no living man might
dare to stand before him. And when he reached
Witig, who was riding Diether's horse, his own being
slain, Witig, like all others turned to flee from that
terrible countenance. "Evil dog", cried Theodoric,
"if thou hast any courage stand and wait till I
come up to thee and avenge the death of my
brother". "I slew him against my will". said Witig,
"and because I had no other way to save my life;
and if I can pay forfeit for his blood with any quantity
of gold and silver, that will I gladly do". But
still he fled as fast as his steed could carry him, down
the course of a stream to where it poured itself into
a lake, and still Theodoric rode after him. But when
Theodoric hurled his spear, in that very moment
Witig sank beneath the waters of the lake and the
spear-shaft was driven deep into the shore, and there it
may be seen to this day. But some men thought that
Witig was received by a mermaid and kept hidden
in her cave for many days. For his grandfather had
been born long ago of this mermaid, having been
begotten by Wilkinus, King of Norway.</p>

<p>So the battle had been won by Theodoric and his
allies (for in other parts of the field the Margrave
Rudiger had vanquished Reinald) yet was it a bootless
<a name="p410" id="p410"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 410</span>
victory by reason of the death of Attila's sons.
And Theodoric, riding back to the battle-field, came
where his brother Diether was lying; and lamented
him saying: "There liest thou; my brother Diether.
This is the greatest sorrow that has befallen me,
that thou art thus untimely slain". And then he
came to the place where lay the young princes, with
their stout coats of mail and their strong helmets,
which had not been able to save them from death,
and he said: "Dear young lords, this is the greatest
of my sorrows that I have lost you; and how
shall I now return to Susat? God knows that I
would gladly have many a gaping wound, if only
you might be whole again". Then he bade Rudiger
lead back the army to its king, for he would neither
claim his own kingdom nor return to the palace of
Susat, after he had cost Attila the lives of so many
brave knights and of his own sons. So Rudiger
returned to the palace, but Theodoric and Master
Hildebrand dwelt in a little hut in the neighbourhood
of the city of Susat.</p>

<p>When Rudiger stood in the presence of Attila,
who asked him of the welfare of Theodoric and of
the host, he made answer: "King Theodoric lives,
and the Huns have been conquerors in the battle,
yet have we had evil fortune, since we have lost the
young lords, Erp and Ortwin". Then Queen Erka
and almost all who were in the palace-hall lifted up
their voices and wept. And Rudiger told Attila how
Diether and many another brave knight had fallen in
the battle. But Attila answered with steadfast soul:
"It has happened now as it ever does. They fall in
<a name="p411" id="p411"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 411</span>
the fight for whom it is so appointed, and neither
mail nor muscle avails them anything. My sons
Erp and Ortwin and their foster-brother Diether had
the best arms that could be fashioned in the smithy,
yet there they all lie dead". And after a space he
added: "Where is my good friend, King Theodoric?"
"He and Master Hildebrand are sitting
together in a mean hut, and they have laid their
arms aside and dare not come into thy presence, O
King! because they have lost the young lords".
Then Attila sent two knights to beg Theodoric to
come into his presence, but he would not for grief
and shame. Then Queen Erka rose up weeping and
went with her maidens to the cottage where Theodoric
abode: and when she entered it she said:
"My good friend, Theodoric! how did my sons fare
in the war, and fought they as good knights ere
they fell?" But Theodoric, with mournful face,
answered: "Lady! they fought as good knights and
parried the blows bravely, and neither of them would
part from the other". And with that she went up to
him and threw her arms round his neck and said:
"Good friend! King Theodoric! come now into the
palace-hall to King Attila, and take thy welcome there,
and be merry once more. Often before now have
the brave men for whom it was appointed, fallen in
the battle; and they who live still must take thought
for themselves, since it profits not to be ever bewailing
the dead". So Theodoric went with the queen
into the palace-hall, and Attila stood up and gave
him a kiss of welcome and bade him sit beside him
on the high-seat. Thus he returned to Attila's
<a name="p412" id="p412"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 412</span>
palace, where he dwelt for yet many years, and all
was friendship between them as before.</p>

<p>Two years after this Queen Erka fell sick of a
grievous disease and lay at the point of death.
Sending for Theodoric, she rehearsed to him how
he had ever been the best friend of her husband and
herself; and as it might well happen that this sickness
would sever that long friendship, she desired to
give him fifteen marks of red gold in a beaker and a
costly purple robe, as memorials of the same, and
she prayed him to take her young kinswoman,
Herauda,<a id="footnotetag172" name="footnotetag172"></a>
<a href="#footnote172"><sup class="sml">172</sup></a> to wife. Theodoric said: "Good lady
and queen! thy sickness is doubtless a dangerous
one. True friendship hast thou ever shown to me
and mine; and better it were for Attila to lose the
half of his kingdom than to lose thee". Thereat he
wept like a child and could say no more words, but
went quickly forth of the chamber.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote172"
name="footnote172"></a><b>Footnote 172:</b><a href="#footnotetag172">
(return) </a> Or Herrat.</blockquote>

<p>Then Erka desired to see her dear friend, Master
Hildebrand, and spake to him too of the true friendship
which was now about to be severed, in remembrance
whereof she gave him a ring of gold. And
then sending for Attila she spake to him of her
coming death. "Thus wilt thou become a widower",
said she, "but so thou wilt not long remain. Choose,
therefore, a good and loving wife, for if thou choosest
a wicked woman she may work much harm to thee
and many others beside. Good King Attila! take
no wife out of Nibelungen-land, nor from the race of
Aldrian, for if thou dost, thou wilt sorely repent of
it, and harm unspeakable will be wrought to thee
<a name="p413" id="p413"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 413</span>
and the children whom she may bear thee". Soon
after she had spoken these words, she gave up the
ghost; and great was the lamentation in all Hun-land
when they heard that the good Queen Erka was no
more in life.</p>

<p>The warning given by the dying queen was, like
most such warnings, unheeded. After three years
of widowerhood, Attila sent one of his nephews into
Nibelungen-land<a id="footnotetag173" name="footnotetag173"></a>
<a href="#footnote173"><sup class="sml">173</sup></a> to ask for the hand of Chriemhild,<a id="footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a>
<a href="#footnote174"><sup class="sml">174</sup></a>
daughter of Aldrian, loveliest and wisest of the
women of her time; but maddened by secret grief
for the loss of her first husband, Siegfried,<a id="footnotetag175" name="footnotetag175"></a>
<a href="#footnote175"><sup class="sml">175</sup></a> who had
been slain by her brothers, Hagen<a id="footnotetag176" name="footnotetag176"></a>
<a href="#footnote176"><sup class="sml">176</sup></a> and King Gunther.
The suit prospered; with strange blindness of
heart, King Gunther gave his consent to the union
of the sister who was his deadliest enemy with the
mightiest king in Europe. For seven years Chriemhild
waited for her revenge; then came that invitation
to the Nibelungs to visit the court of Attila,
which, in the infatuation of their souls, King Gunther
and his brethren accepted, taking with them a chosen
band of a thousand warriors. The scheme of vengeance
prepared by Chriemhild, the quarrel which
she provoked at the banquet, the terrible slaughter
suffered and inflicted by the Nibelungs in the palace
garden, their desperate rush into the palace-hall, the
stand made therein by their ever-dwindling band on
the pavement which was slippery with the gore of
<a name="p414" id="p414"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 414</span>
heroes--all this has been sung by a hundred minstrels,
and need not here be repeated. We have only to
do with the share Theodoric and his friends took in
the fatal combat. Long the Amalungs stood utterly
aloof from the fray, grieving sorely that so many of
their friends on both sides were falling by one another's
hands. For to the Nibelungs, as well as to
Attila and the Huns, were they bound by the ties
of guest-friendship, and in happier days Theodoric
had ridden with Gunther and with Hagen, to test
the mettle of their knights against the chivalry
of Britain. So Theodoric and his men stood on the
battlement of his palace, which looked down on
the garden of Attila, and watched from afar the
ghastly conflict. But at length they saw the good
Margrave Rudiger, the ally of the Amals on so many
a hard-fought battle-field, fall by the hand of his own
daughter's husband, the young prince, Giselher; and
then could Theodoric bear it no longer, but cried,
saying: "Now is my best friend, Margrave Rudiger,
dead. Take your weapons, comrades, and let us
avenge his fall". He descended into the street.
He forced his way into the palace-hall. Terrible
was the clang of the strong sword Ecke-sax on the
helmets of the Nibelungs. Many of them fell before
him, but alas! many of his faithful Amals fell there
also, far from their home. At length, in all that
stately palace-hall, there remained but four men still
able to deal blows, and these were Theodoric and
Master Hildebrand of the Amalungs, Hagen and
Giselher of their foes. And Hagen stood up to
fight with Theodoric, and Giselher with Hildebrand.
<a name="p415" id="p415"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 415</span>
Then, as King Attila came from his tower to watch
the combat, Hagen shouted to him: "It were a
knightly deed to let young Giselher go unhurt, for
he is innocent of the death of Siegfried the Swift".
"Yea, truly", said Giselher; "Chriemhild, my sister,
knows that I was a little child of five years old in my
mother's bed when her husband was killed. I am
innocent of this blood-feud, yet care I not to live
now that my brethren are slain". Therewith he
closed in fight with Master Hildebrand, and soon
received his death-wound from the old hero.</p>

<p>Now there remained but one terrible encounter,
that between Hagen and Theodoric. Hagen said: "It
seems that here our friendship must come to an end,
great as it has ever been. Let us each fight bravely
for his life, and knight-like, call on no man for aid".
Theodoric answered: "Truly, I will let none meddle
in this encounter, but will fight it with warlike skill
and knightliness". They fought long and hard, and
exchanged grievous blows, and both were weary
and both were wounded. Then Theodoric waxed
exceeding wroth with himself for not overcoming
his foe, and said: "Truly, this is a shame for me to
stand here all the day and not to be able to vanquish
the elfin's son". "Why should the elfin's son be
worse than the son of the devil himself?" answered
Hagen.<a id="footnotetag177" name="footnotetag177"></a>
<a href="#footnote177"><sup class="sml">177</sup></a> At that Theodoric was seized with such fury that fiery breath issued from his mouth. Hagen's coat
<a name="p416" id="p416"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 416</span>
of mail was heated red-hot by this breath of fire, and
he was forced to cry out: "I give myself up. Anything
to end this torture and doff my red-hot
armour. If I were a fish, and not a man, I should be
broiled in this burning panoply". Then Theodoric
sat down and began to unbrace his adversary's
armour; and while he was doing this, Queen Chriemhild
came into the hall with a blazing torch, which
she thrust into the mouth of one after another of
the prostrate warriors, her brothers, to see if they
were already dead, and to slay them if they were
still living. Beholding this, Theodoric said to Attila:
"See how that devil, Chriemhild, thy wife, torments
her brethren, the noble heroes. See how
many brave men, Huns and Amalungs and Nibelungs,
have yielded up their life for her sake. And
in like fashion would she bring thee and me to
death, if she had the power". "Truly, she is a
devil", answered Attila. "Do thou slay her; and it
had been a good deed if thou hadst done it seven
nights ago. Then would many a noble knight be
still living who now is dead". And with that Theodoric
sprang up and clove Chriemhild in twain.</p>

<p>Theodoric bore the sore-wounded Hagen to his
palace and bound up his wounds; but they were
mortal, and in a few days Hagen died, having bequeathed
to the woman who nursed him the secret
of the great Nibelung hoard, for the sake of which
he had slain Siegfried the Swift.</p>

<p>In the terrible encounter there had fallen one
thousand Nibelungs, being all their host, and four
thousand Huns and Amalungs. No battle is more
<a name="p417" id="p417"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 417</span>
celebrated in the old German Sagas than this. But
Hun-land was wasted by reason of the death of so
many valiant warriors, and thus had come to pass
all the evil which the good Queen Erka had foretold.</p>

<p>And now after thirty-two years of exile, and with
so many of his brave followers dead, Theodoric's
heart pined more than ever for his native land, and
he said to Master Hildebrand: "I would rather die
in Verona than live any longer in Hun-land". To
return with an army was hopeless, so scanty a remnant
was left of the Amalungs. The only hope was
to steal back secretly and try if it were possible to
find friends enough in the old home to win back the
crown. Master Hildebrand knew of one thing which
made the outlook less desperate: "I have heard
that the Duke who rules over Verona is a brave
knight named Alebrand; and I cannot but think
that this is my son, born of my wife, Uta, shortly
after I fled hither". So they got together four horses,
two for Theodoric and Hildebrand, one for the lady,
Herauda, Theodoric's wife, and one to carry their
raiment and store of silver and gold; and after
leave taken of Attila, who wept bitterly at Theodoric's
departure, and prayed him to stay till he
could fit out another army for his service, they set
forth from Susat and rode westward night and day,
avoiding the towns and the haunts of wayfarers.
On their road they were met by a band of two and
thirty knights commanded by Earl Elsung, a kinsman
of that Elsung of Verona, whom Theodoric's
grandfather, Samson, had slain. The blood-feud
was now old, but Elsung yearned to avenge it on
<a name="p418" id="p418"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 418</span>
Theodoric. The lady Herauda wept when she saw
so many well-armed knights approaching, but Theodoric
bade her be of joyous heart till she saw one of
her two protectors fall, and that, he deemed, would
never be. And in truth, in the fight that followed,
so well did the aged Hildebrand wield the sword
Gram, the wondrous sword of Siegfried the Swift,
and such mighty blows dealt Theodoric with Ecke-sax,
that Earl Elsung himself and sixteen of his men
were left dead on the field. The rest fled, all but
a nephew of Elsung, a brave young knight. Him
also Hildebrand vanquished in fight, and from him,
as ransom for his life, the victors received great
tidings from Amalungen-land. For he told them
that Hermanric was grievously sick, and that the
remedies which the false Sibich had persuaded him
to resort to had left him far weaker than before, and,
in short, the great Hermanric was already as good
as dead.</p>

<p>They came next in their journey to a castle which
was held by Duke Lewis and his son Conrad. To
them Master Hildebrand, riding forward, made himself
known, and from them he received joyous welcome.
They rode back with him into the forest,
where Theodoric was tarrying with the Lady
Herauda, and bent the knee before him. For they
had heard that Hermanric was dead, and though the
false Sibich aspired to be king after him, both they
and all the people in those parts chose rather to
obey Theodoric, and had sent a messenger into Hun-land
to pray him to return. Theodoric received
Duke Lewis graciously, but would not enter into his
<a name="p419" id="p419"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 419</span>
castle, for he had sworn that Verona should be the
first stronghold in Amalungen-land within whose
walls he would enter.</p>

<p>Now of Verona the lord was (as Hildebrand had
heard) his son Alebrand, born after he had left the
country. He was a brave knight, and a courteous,
but fiery, and when the aged Hildebrand, riding towards
Verona, met him in the way, the two champions
rushed at one another, and fought long and desperately.
The battle ceased from the mere weariness of
the fighters once and again. At every pause each
knight, the old and the young, asked the other of
his name, and each refused to tell his name till he
had heard that of his antagonist. And this, though
all the time Hildebrand more than guessed that it
was his own son from whom he was receiving, and
to whom he was dealing, such dreadful blows. At
length, after Hildebrand had given his opponent a
great gaping wound in the thigh, he fell upon him
and bore him to the earth, and then with his sword
at his breast said: "Tell me thy name or thou shalt
die". "I care not for life", said the other, "since so
old a man has vanquished me". "If thou wilt preserve
thy life, tell me straightway if thou art my
son Alebrand; if so, I am thy father, Hildebrand".
"If thou art my father Hildebrand, I am thy son
Alebrand", said the younger hero. And with that
they both arose, threw their arms around each other's
necks, and kissed one another; and both were right
glad, and they mounted their horses and rode
towards Verona. From the gates the Lady Uta,
Alebrand's mother, was coming forth to meet her
<a name="p420" id="p420"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 420</span>
son; but she wept and wailed when she saw his
streaming wound, and said: "Oh, my son, why art
thou so sore wounded, and who is that aged man
that is following thee?" Alebrand answered: "For
this wound I need have no shame, sith it was given
me by my father, Hildebrand, and it is he who rides
behind me". Then was the mother overjoyed, and
greeted her husband lovingly, and with great gladness
they entered into the city, where Hildebrand
tarried for the night, and the Lady Uta bound up the
wounds of Alebrand.<a id="footnotetag178" name="footnotetag178"></a>

The combat between Hildebrand and Alebrand, the impetuous
father and the impetuous son, too proud to let words take the place of blows, is, with some variations, a favourite theme of German minstrels. In the "Hildebrands-hed" (beginning of the 9th century)
the son is named Hadubrand, and he insists on the fight because he
looks upon the so-called Hildebrand as an imposter (Grimm:
"Deutsche Heldensage", 25).</blockquote>

<p>After this Theodoric's course was easy. He was
received with joyous welcome by the citizens of his
native Verona, as he rode through the streets on his
faithful Falke, Master Hildebrand of the long white
beard holding high his banner. Alebrand handed
back to his keeping Verona and all Amalungen-land,
which he had received to hold from the dead Hermanric.
Theodoric sat in the high-seat of the palace;
the people brought him rich presents, and all the
nobles took him for their rightful lord and ruler.</p>

<p>The false Sibich marched against him with a larger
army, thirteen thousand to Theodoric's eight thousand;
but Theodoric and Hildebrand rode as they
pleased through the armed throng, dealing death on
every side; and Duke Alebrand, engaging Sibich in
<a name="p421" id="p421"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 421</span>
single combat, after long fight, waxed exceeding
wroth, and smiting a dreadful blow, clove him
through from the shoulder to the saddle-bow. Then
all the Romans gave up the strife, and fell at
Theodoric's feet, praying him to be their lord. So
was Theodoric crowned in the city of Rome; and
now he was king over all the lands which had once
owned the sway of Hermanric.</p>

<p>It needs not to tell at length of the deeds of
Theodoric after he had recovered his kingdom. He
caused a statue to be cast in copper of himself,
seated on his good steed Falke, and this statue many
pilgrims to Rome have seen.<a id="footnotetag179" name="footnotetag179"></a>

<p>Also a statue of himself, standing on a high tower, brandishing his
good sword Ecke-sax towards the north; and this statue is at Verona.</p>

<p>In his old age he and many of his subjects turned
to the Christian faith. One of those that were baptized
along with him was Master Hildebrand, who
died soon after his conversion, being either one hundred
and eighty or two hundred years old. Theodoric's
wife, Herauda, died also about this time, a
good woman and much loved of the people for all
her gracious deeds, even as her cousin, Erka, had
been loved by the Huns. After Herauda's death
Theodoric married Isold, widow of Hertnit, King
of Bergara,<a id="footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a>
<a href="#footnote180"><sup class="sml">180</sup></a>
whose husband had been slain by a
terrible dragon, which Theodoric vanquished. She
was fair to look upon and wise of heart.</p>

<a name="p422" id="p422"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 422</span>

<p>And after these things it came to pass that old
King Attila died, being enticed by Aldrian, the son
of Hagen, into the cave where the great Nibelung
hoard lay hidden. And when he was in the recesses
of the mountain, gloating over the wondrous treasure,
Aldrian passed swiftly forth and closed the
doors of the cave and left him to perish of hunger in
the midst of the greatest treasure that was in the
world. Thus Aldrian avenged the death of his
father and of all the Nibelungs. But Theodoric was
made king over Hun-land by the help of his friends
in that realm, and thus he became the mightiest
king in the world.</p>

<p>Of all his old warriors only Heime was left,
and Heime had buried himself in a convent, where
he sang psalms every day with the monks, and
did penance for his sins. Theodoric, hearing that
he was there, sought him out, but long time
Heime denied that he was Heime. "Much snow
has fallen", said Theodoric, "on my head and on
thine since our steeds drank the stream dry in
Friesland. Our hair was then yellow as gold, and
fell in curls over our shoulders; now is it white as a
dove". And then he plied him with one memory
after another of the joyous old times of the battle
and the banquet, till at length Heime confessed,
and said: "Good lord Theodoric, I do remember all
of which thou hast spoken, and now will I go forth
with thee from this place". And with that he
fetched his armour from the convent-chest, and his
good old steed Rispa from the convent-stable, and
once more rode gladly after his lord. After doing
<a name="p423" id="p423"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 423</span>
many more brave deeds, he fell in battle with a
giant, the biggest and clumsiest of his tribe. Theodoric,
riding forth alone, sought out the giant's lair,
and with his good sword Ecke-sax avenged the
death of his friend; and that was the last battle that
the son of Dietmar fought with mortal foe.</p>

<p>The years of Theodoric's old age were given to
the chase of the beasts of the forest, for he was still
a mighty hunter when his other strength was gone.<a id="footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote181"

(return) </a> It is probably the following legend that is commemorated
on the façade of the church of S. Zenone of Verona, where Theodoric is represented as chasing a stag and met by the Devil.</blockquote>

<p>One day as he was bathing at the place which is
still called "Theodoric's Bath", a groom called out
to him: "My lord! a stag has just rushed past, the
greatest and the finest that ever I saw in my life".
With that Theodoric wrapped a bathing-cloak round
him, and calling for his horse, prepared to set off in
chase of the stag. The horse was long in coming,
and meanwhile a mighty steed, coal-black, suddenly
appeared before him. Theodoric sprang upon the
strange charger's back, and it flew off with him as
swiftly as a bird. His best groom on his best horse
followed vainly behind. "My lord", cried he, "when
wilt thou come back, that thou ridest so fast and
far". But Theodoric knew by this time that it was
no earthly steed that he was bestriding, and from
which he vainly tried to unclasp his legs. "I am
ill-mounted", cried he to the groom. "This must
be the foul fiend on which I ride. Yet will I return,
if God wills and Holy Mary". With that he vanished
from his servant's sight, and since then no man
<a name="p424" id="p424"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 424</span>
has seen and no man ever will see Theodoric of
Verona. Yet some German minstrels say that it
has been opened to them in dreams that he has
found grace at last, because in his death-ride he
called on the names of God and the Virgin Mary.<a id="footnotetag182" name="footnotetag182"></a>

Another version of the "Wilkina-Saga" gives a different account
of the death of Theodoric. According to this, Witig, after he sank in
the lake, was received by his mermaid ancestress and borne away to
Zealand. Here he abode a long time, till he heard of the return and
recovered might of Theodoric. Then, fearing his resentment, he
betook himself to a certain island, and having made an image of
Theodoric, laid a strict charge upon the boatman who ferried passengers
across that he should carry over none who was like that image.
Theodoric, hearing that Witig yet lived in Denmark, went thither,
and, having disfigured himself so that the boatman did not recognise
him, found Witig (whose sword Mimung he had hidden away), and
challenged him to single combat. The battle of the boys was thus
renewed between the two snow-bearded men, and was fatal to both.
Witig fell down dead by his own bedside; and Theodoric, stricken with
incurable wounds, journeyed through Holstem and Saxony to Swabia.
Here he went to the border of a lake, and drawing the sword Mimung
out of its sheath, hurled it afar into the waters, so that it should
never again come into the hands of man. He then went into a little
Swabian town, and the next day died there of his wounds. He
strictly forbade his servants to make mention of his name or rank,
and was buried in that town as a merchant. It is needless to remark
on the resemblance of one part of this story to the "Passing of
Arthur".</blockquote>

<p>I have thus endeavoured to bring before the
reader (I hope not with undue prolixity) the chief
events in the life of the mythical Theodoric of the
Middle Ages. Still, as late as the sixteenth century
the common people loved to talk of this mighty
hero. The Bavarian "Chronicle" (translated and
continued about 1580) says: "Our people sing and
<a name="p425" id="p425"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 425</span>
talk much about 'Dietrich von Bern.' You would
not soon find an ancient king who is so well known
to the common people amongst us, or about whom
they have so much to say".<a id="footnotetag183" name="footnotetag183"></a>
<a href="#footnote183"><sup class="sml">183</sup></a> What they had to
say was, as the reader will have observed, strangely
removed from the truth of history. How all this
elaborate superstructure of romance could be reared
on the mere name of Theodoric of Verona is almost
inconceivable to us, till we call to mind that the
minstrels were in truth the novelists of the Middle
Ages, not pretending or desiring to instruct, but only
to amuse and interest their hearers, and to beguile
the tedium of existence in dull baronial castles.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote183"

<p>Of the thousand and one details contained in the
foregoing narrative, there are not more than three or
four which correspond with the life of the real
Theodoric, He was, as the Saga says, of Amal
lineage. His father's name, Theudemir, is fairly
enough represented by Dietmar. He was for some
years of his life (but not his middle or later life) a
wanderer more or less dependent on the favour of a
powerful sovereign. His life during this period did
get entangled with that of another Theodoric, even
as the life of the hero of Saga becomes entangled
with the life of Theodoric of Russia. After subduing
all his enemies, he did eventually rule in Rome,
and erect statues to himself there and at Verona.
Ravenna and Verona were the places of his most
frequent residence. In his mature years, when his
whole soul was set on the maintenance of <i>civilitas</i>,
he might very fitly have spoken such words as he is
<a name="p426" id="p426"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 426</span>
said to have used to Witig in his boyhood, "I will
establish such peace in my father's realm and mine,
that it shall not be in the power of every wandering
adventurer to challenge me to single combat".
Moreover, throughout all the wild vagaries of the
narrative, character, that mysterious and indestructible
essence, is not wholly lost. No two books can
be more absolutely unlike one another than the
"Wilkina-Saga" and the "Various Letters of Cassiodorus",
yet the same hot-tempered, impulsive, generous
man is pourtrayed to us by both.</p>

<p>As for the other names introduced, they are, of
course, brought in at the cost of the strangest anachronisms.
The cruel uncle, Hermanric, is really a
remote collateral ancestor who died nearly eighty
years before Theodoric was born. The generous
host and ally, Attila, died two years before his birth,
and the especial gladness of that birth was that it
occurred at the same time with a signal victory of
the Amal kings over the sons of Attila. To take an
illustration from modern history, the general framework
of the "Wilkina-Saga" is about as accurate as a
romance would be which should represent Queen
Victoria as driven from her throne by the Old Pretender,
remaining for thirty years an exile at the
court of Napoleon, and at length recovering her
kingdom on the Old Pretender's death.<a id="footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a>

Possibly we have in the career of Witig, the craftsman's son,
successively the sworn friend and the deadly foe of Theodoric and his
house, some remembrance of the life of the low-born Witigis, in his
youth a valiant soldier of Theodoric, in his old age the slayer of
Theodahad, and the hated husband of Amalasuentha.</blockquote>

<a name="p427" id="p427"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 427</span>

<p>But, as has been often and well pointed out, the
most marvellous thing in these old German Sagas is
the utter disappearance from them of that Roman
Empire which at the cost of such giant labour the
Teutonic nations had overthrown. The Roman
Imperator, the Roman legions, even the Catholic
priests with their pious zeal against Arianism, count
for nothing in the story. Just as the knightly warriors
prick to and fro on their fiery steeds to the
court of Arthur of Britain, with no mention of the
intervening sea, so these German bards link together
the days of Chivalry and the old barbarian life which
Tacitus paints for us in the "Germania", without apparently
any consciousness of the momentous deed
which the German warriors had in the meanwhile
performed, full of significance for all succeeding
generations of men, the overthrow of the Empire of
Rome.</p>
